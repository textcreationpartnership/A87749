            <title>A way to sion sought out, and found, for believers to walke in. Or, A treatise consisting of three parts. In the first part is proved, 1. That God hath had a people on earth, ever since the comming of Christ in the flesh, throughout the darkest times of popery, which he hath owned as saints, and as his Church. 2. That these saints have power to reassume and take up as their right, any ordinance of Christ, which they have beene deprived of by the violence and tyranny of the man of sin. Wherein it is cleared up by scriptures, and arguments grounded upon scripture, who of right may administer ordinances, and amongst the rest the ordinance of baptisme with water. The 2. part containeth a full and large answer to 13. exceptions against the practice of baptizing believers, wherein the former particulars are more fully cleared up. The 3. part proveth that outward ordinances, and amongst the rest the ordinance of baptisme is to continue in the church, and this truth cleared up from intricate turnings &amp; windings, clouds &amp; mists that make the way doubtful &amp; dark. / By Daniel King, preacher of the Word neere Coventry.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Third part of this Treatise is to vindicate the Truth, in regard of the continuance of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances commanded in the New Testament, to be practiced by the Saints of God: Which is denyed by some, by reason of whom many of the Saints are drawne off from yeelding that obedience to Jesus Christ as he requireth in his Word.</p>
            <p>It is the usuall manner of some men, to draw their application, (whatsoever Text or Point they preach upon) still to the throwing downe of outward Ordinances and Institutions. Tell people they must be now carried on by the Spirit, all in Spirit; and not matter any outward thing, which perisheth with the using: And so some labour to be at downe Baptisme with water, and the Supper; as Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> in his Book entituled, <hi>(Some beams of that bright morning Star.)</hi> And he that writeth the Doctrine of Baptisme, pleading mainly against Baptisme with water; yet cry downe in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall all outwards (as usually they doe) without distinction: And so cause many people to contemn (by such generall crying down of all externalls) that which some of them will allow of, as preaching &amp;c. Some againe, cry downe preaching, reading, hearing; among the rest, as Mr. <hi>George Hassall,</hi> a Member of the Army, in his little book called <hi>(The designe of God in man.)</hi> Some again, saying, Prayer by word of mouth, is but an invention of man, and therefore despise both the thing, and the people that pray; and some taking liberty to all manner of loosenesse from this Tenet; yea, and many of them contemne the Scriptures, under the terme Letter. Some calling them a peece of confusion,
<note place="margin">E. E. W. E.</note> and scoffe at them as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory. Others saying, they can write as good Epistles as <hi>Paul.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:165581:3"/>Others saying,
<note place="margin">D. P.</note> the Scriptures are but for information what was done, not a rule to us for our duties that we must doe; saying, the Epistles,
<note place="margin">W. L.</note> of the Apostles were but to particular Churches for that time, or Age, but not reaching this Age; saying, they would not cite Scripture but to stoop to the weaknesse of some. Some other affirming, that the outward Court given to the Gentiles, <hi>Rev. 11.1.</hi> is all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Profession,
<note place="margin">W. S.</note> Wisdome, Art, Knowledge, Gifts, Churches, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, SCRIPTƲRES, Government, all these things are the outward Court, &amp;c. I shall here goe as briefly to worke as I can: And I adde this to my Treatise formerly written, because there are many new objections made, which were not then come to light. And here I must of necessity deal with many things in Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> his book, because many that I hear plead, plead his Arguments, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most <hi>verbatim;</hi> and the Book is much admired with many people, taking the things therein as an Oracle of God; beleeving it, though there be no Scripture proof for many things affirmed, or many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures cited impertinently: And so the Doctrine of Baptismes, the like.</p>
            <p>I professe I doe not bear the least hatred to any mans person, but love to the TRƲTH, and the Glory of God, causeth me to deal with these Books, because there is the substance of what is pleaded against Ordinances, and the use of them. And I shall not deal with every thing in them, but onely such places as have greatest shew of strength in them against this thing. Let no man say, I deal with Mr. <hi>Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marshes</hi> book because he is dead, and cannot answer. I say no: for I had gathered Answers to many things before he was dead, and made account, had I had opportunity, to have bad them in the Presse before I heard of his death: And however he be dead, his Booke yet speaketh, and that I deale with. And though he be dead, I make no question, but there are enough alive of his judgement in this thing to vindicate him, if I should doe him wrong: But it is the Tenet written and affirmed, and not the man, that I speake to; though I sometimes name him. And I rather choose to pitch upon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections made there principally, because I think he hath said all that can be said to that point; as Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> was moved by the same reason to answer Mr. <hi>Marshals</hi> Sermon about Baptisme.</p>

Therefore Statutes and Ordinances are put together, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.25. <hi>Joshu.</hi> 24.25. And that it is a Law, or Command, see <hi>Num.</hi> 15.15.16. and 19.2. <hi>Isa.</hi> 24.5. and a Testimony, <hi>Psal.</hi> 99.7. That it is a Command, see plainly, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.8.

               <p>Now then, If Gods Commands, and Christs Commands continue, and are to be observed, then his Ordinances continue; for they are the same thing: If that which he appointed be to be observed, for it is the same. (I speak not of Legall Ordinances which were abolished by the death of Christ.) Therefore the Magistrate is called Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, because he appointed Magistracy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.6. speaking of the Appointments of the Old Testament, he saith, <hi>When these things were thus ordained, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then, Seeing Christs Ordinances are his Commandements, and his Commandements his Ordinances: <hi>I</hi> shall prove that his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, or Ordinances, are to be observed by his people; and that there is no time wherein they are freed from obedience. See what Christ saith to his Disciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.15. <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:165581:4"/>And telleth them, if they doe so, <hi>They shall abide in his love,</hi> Joh. 15.10. And therefore in 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 6 he calleth this love, to walk after his Commandements; and not to desert them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He saith, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 2.4. <hi>He that keepeth not his Commandements, is a liar. And hee that keepeth them dwelleth in God, and God in him,</hi> 1 John 3.24.</p>

               <p>Now then, If Christ would have his people love him at all times; If he give no allowance for men to be liars; If he will inhabit in his people, and they in him, at all times; if he will have men taught; If some mens sins shall be taken off of them, and their state better at last, then at first, at all times; If there be some that shall be blessed at all times; Then the Commandements of Christ must be kept at all times: But the former is true, by all those Propositions and Scriptures: Therefore the latter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Consider, If there were a time wherein men were freed from keeping the Commandements of Christ, then there would be a time wherein they need not beleeve, nor love the Saints, nor repent, nor children honour their Parents, nor men be tyed to dwell with their wives; for all these are Commandements, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. But there is no time wherein men are freed from these things; therefore no time wherein they are freed from keeping Christs Commandements.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If there be a time wherein the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven in flaming fire, rendring vengeance to all them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel; Then the Commands of Christ are to be observed. But the former is true, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9. Therefore the latter.</p>
               <p n="4">4 If there be no time wherein Christ shall cease to rule, and governe, and give Laws, and Commands, and to be King while this world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth; Then there is no time of the ceasing of his Lawes, or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, or Commands.

               <p>We allow the Commandements of God are to be observed; but what are they? you may see, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. His Commandement is to beleeve in Christ, and love one another; and that we do.</p>
               <p>I answer, Doth he meane beleeving on his Son Jesus Christ meerly, without fruits of faith, or works?

For if you meane by this Commandement a bare beleeving or assent, without fruits or workes; Then that Command, <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord alway,</hi> is no Command now: <hi>Do all to the glory of God,</hi> is no Command now:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31.</note> And then you will make <hi>Paul</hi> in a great mistake, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.8. that willeth it to be constantly affirmed, That they which have beleeved in God, <hi>be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to maintaine good workes.</hi> But if it reach to faith, with all its workes; Then we acknowledge it a Commandement after Gods minde; wee dare not curtal it, as some of them do because beleeving taketh in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.30, 31.

               <p>Againe, for love commanded there; Doth he meane love onely in word, or in deed? Doth it not take in the whole Law of God, and every Precept under this one terme? Did not the great Commandement, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, &amp;c.</hi> take in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Precepts, the 1, 2, 3, and 4. the Commandements of the first Table.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:165581:5"/>nor slander them, nor desire their enjoyments from them. Did Christ mean to cut off the particular Precepts, when he said these were the Commandements? And all the Law is fulfilled in one word, LOVE; did he meane in speaking the word,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.14</note> and talking of it, as many of these men do, are doing it? Sure it taketh in love, with all the appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances; It taketh in as well relieving of a brothers wants, as to give him fine words, and an humble carriage, and to tell him I love him; for what doth it profit else?

               <p>But I finde another Objection by a distinction in Mr. <hi>Saltmersh</hi> his Book, Page 245. <q>Some say outward Ordinances are Commands of Christ,

               </p>
               <p>Others say (whereof he was one, as his Book sheweth) <q>That out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ordinances as in the Letter, are the Old Testament Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a legall Ministration of <hi>Johns</hi> Ministery, or Christs under the Law, or in flesh: And that such Ordinances as the Lord Jesus Christ commanded while he lived in the Ministery of the Law, made under the Law, a Minister of Circumcision, and not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Christ, as in meer spirit and glory, and a Minister of his fulnesse in that more excellent condition. And the not distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ in flesh, and so teaching and commanding; and as in Spirit and so Ministering in pure Spirit and Glory, is the ground of all such legall Doctrines, and use of Ordinances in bondage, as is this day in the letter; either of Baptisme, Church-fellowship, &amp;c.</q>

<note place="margin">Acts 1.3.</note> or else he did not ascend out of Flesh into Spirit, as he saith; And he gave commands concerning his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which his Disciples should teach and practise, between his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Ascention; and if he were Christ in Flesh then, as <hi>pag.</hi> 105 affirmeth, it may as well be said, his kingdome is fleshly; but we are to looke for no other commands, but what we finde recorded in the New Testament, and practised by the Disciples of Christ, to whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his will; for these commands are Spirituall, and to prove it, let that place be wel considered, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.3. after he by the HOLY GHOST had
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:165581:6"/>given COMMANDMENTS to the Apostles whom he had chosen. That which is done by the Holy Ghost is Spirituall, but the commands of Christ to his Apostles, were given by the Holy Ghost before his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scention, therefore they are Spirituall, and not legall, and of Christ in flesh.</p>
               <p>And if all the commands that he gave in the Body, or before his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scention be legall, then his sending them out to preach the GOSPEL was legall, for then he was in the Body; and so this must be laid downe also.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, he sent <hi>Paul</hi> to preach after his Ascention, and therefore that is Evangelicall.
<note place="margin">Acts 22, 14, 15 &amp; 26.17, 18</note> I answer; he gave not <hi>Paul</hi> a new commission dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from the other, nor more Spirituall, but the same; neither did <hi>Paul</hi> preach another Gospel, but the same; as appeareth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.6.7, 8,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.23</note> 9. and then I hope they will grant the observation of the Supper to be a command from Christ in Spirit, for that was given to <hi>Paul;</hi> and the maintaining of order, and fellowship, and ordinances too, for he gave commands concerning these things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. &amp;c. and the 14. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoughout, and affirmeth the things that he wrote to them were the commandements of the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.37.</p>
               <p>And if this be so, that all the commands that Christ gave in the flesh, or body, be legall, then it will follow, that the Scriptures of the New Testament will be found legall also; for the Apostles were to teach no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be observed, but what he had commanded them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>ult.</hi> and mark there, he doth not say, what I SHALL command you; but, <hi>what I HAVE commanded you;</hi> which was, when he was Christ in flesh; for (saith Master <hi>Saltmarsh</hi>) he went into Spirit when he ascended. So that you see this distinction maketh to the destruction of the Scripture it selfe.</p>
               <p>I have been the more large in answering of it, because it had almost deceived me one time, till God moved me to consider seriously of the weight and truth of it, and then I found it too light.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> saith, about pag. 58. <q>The ministration of Christ in flesh was in gifts and ordinances, &amp;c. for (saith he) the flesh of Christ, in which he taught, and wrought Miracles, was Circumcised, and Baptised.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answer; if he will allow us to walke as Christ did, in ordinances whilst we live in the body, the contention is ended. Did Christ say them downe before he dyed? 2. Christ was circumcised, and bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to fulfill all righteousnesse both of the Law, and Gospel, and to yeeld to obey God in all things: so must we use ordinances in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Christ. 3. Hence we may conclude, that if gifts, and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and miracles cease, because it was a lower administration of Christ in flesh; surely then teaching, or preaching in the flesh must cease al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so; for when he did the one, he did the other. And if they doe but stick to these principles, and be against all preaching in the flesh, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:165581:6"/>prayer in the flesh, and conference in the flesh, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> in the body, for so he meaneth-here, I conceive, by the expression; then they would not confound themselves in one tenat so often, crying out against ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and yet practicing some as outward as others.</p>
               <p>These obstructions being taken out of the way, I now proceed to prove the ordinances that some so much plead against, to be commands of Christ.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Baptisme with water is a command of Christ appeareth,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Baptisme with water proved a command of Christ.</hi> page 149, &amp;c.</note> Mat. 28.18. <hi>All power is given to me in heaven, and earth; goe ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore teach all Nations, baptising them, &amp;c.</hi> That this is with water I have proved, and to this adde that of the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 2.38. <hi>Repent, and be baptised, every one of you.</hi> Here you see, it was <hi>Peters</hi> direction, and injunction in case they would embrace the Gospel, to repent, and be baptised.

Because it is joyned with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, with which it went; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. which Doctrine <hi>John</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to those he baptised. 3. Because it is said to be a Baptisme into the name of the Lord Iesus, which is the baptisme with water, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.16. <hi>They w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And so <hi>Act.</hi> 10.48. &amp; 19.5. so that there is another command for baptising with water. And let not any man thinke this was <hi>Peters</hi> ignorance, for <hi>Peter</hi> did it by an infallible Spirit, even while he sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.26</note> and as being the thing meant in the commission, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. for if he understood not his commission, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit had not taught them all things, and Christ promised it should;
<note place="margin">Rom. 3.4</note>
                  <hi>Therefore let God be true, and every man a lyar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But some may say, This is not Christs command; I answer, Apostles commands were Christs commands; therefore saith the same man that giveth these commands, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Be mindfull of the commandement of us, the Apostles of our Lord and Saviour;</hi> So that here is Apostolicall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand even of Christ in Spirit, and in that pure anoynting; for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme with water.</p>
               <p>If any object, <hi>Peter</hi> commanded them to be baptised, but that doth not reach us now. I answer. Let them prove by Scripture that it was commanded upon any speciall reason that concerned them only, if they can, and then I shall further consider of it. I may as well say, But NOW he commandeth all men every where to repent, <hi>Act,</hi> 17.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:165581:7"/>even to the end of the world.</hi> Now this cannot be, I am with you only, for they lived not till the end of the world: But with you, and those that succeed you, teaching and baptising as you doe, till the end of the world.</p>
               <p>But Master <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> objecteth against this, pag. 134. and saith, <q>To the end of the world, is, if more clearly translated, to the finishing of the age, or that age of Ministration. And pag, 110. he saith, Those Gospell Institutions, and Ministrations were only for that age, as the Tabernacle for its age, and Sacrifices for their age, and the Flesh of Christ for its age.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Mark here,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The objection that</hi> Mat. 28. <hi>was only for that age, answered.</hi>
                  </note> he calleth them GOSPEL institutions, and administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereas before he said, they were of the Law; so that he both denyeth and confesseth the same thing. Therefore Reader bring things to triall, looke before thou leap.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Here is affirmations, but no Scripture to second this affertion, or to discover any such thing; the Reader must take his bare word.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The Tabernacle and Sacrifices, and Flesh of Christ, were put to an end by Christ himselfe; let us see a Scripture proofe where Christ hath put an end to preaching, and baptising, and other Gospell ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; all things instituted formerly stood, till he that instituted them did abolish them; and so must these Gospell institutions, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations now doe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All the English Translations that I have seen (which are diverse) read it to the end of the world; and I am informed by some that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Greeke (that since are of that judgement) it is plaine World, and not Age; and some other Greeke Schollars say, the Greek is word for word; Loe, I am with you all dayes to the completion of time, which is all one with the English.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Suppose the reading be so, it is nothing materiall whether we read it World, or Age, the word is all one in divers Scriptures, as <hi>Heb,</hi> 11.3 The worlds were framed by the Word of God, or Ages, as Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> writeth. <hi>So Hebr.</hi> 1.2. by whom he made the worlds, or ages, or times; for the Scripture hath no such expression of Tabernacle age, and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice age, therefore it was but their time that they stood. Now from Christs comming in the Flesh till the end of the world is called, the last time, or days, or age, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.2. <hi>In these LAST DAYES God hath spoken to us by his Sonne,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.18. <hi>Little children, it is the last time, and as ye have heard that Antichrist should come, even now are there many Antichrists in the world, whereby we know it is the last TIME.</hi> So that there is no more ages, or times, for the Apostles lived in the last; therefore it may be age, or world; for read whether you will, it is till the last day. And if age doe not signifie world, as the age doth, as I have shewed, then it alwaies meaneth a mans life, a Generation; as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.7. and 3.5.21. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26. so that if it be not world, as it is translated in the English, but age; then it is Generation; and if so, then it should have been ages, because
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:165581:7"/>all the Apostles did not dye at one time, and so must needs be severall Ages.</p>
               <p>Againe, if Baptisme lasted but in the time of those gifts, as he would have it; then preaching lasted no longer: for there is the Commission for preaching the Gospell: And then how it can be preached to every creature under Heaven, according to <hi>Marke</hi> 16. (which is the same Commission) I cannot see, unlesse every creature lived in that Age.</p>
               <p>Againe consider, the Apostles did not fulfill their Commission, if that were the meaning, <hi>Go teach all Nations:</hi> But there were divers Nations that then were not known, as the Nations in <hi>America;</hi> a part of the world that the Scripture mentioneth not; Therefore the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission reacheth others in after times as well as those men.</p>
               <p>Again consider, Christ injoyned his Apostles or Disciples, to teach those that they had taught, to observe all things that he had commanded them; That was to preach, and Baptise &amp;c.
<note place="margin">There is differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between a Command and a gift, and miracles is onely a gift.</note> He had not commanded them gifts and miracles, but promised they should enjoy those gifts, and have power to doe those miracles; so that we must distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Command and a Promise, so that the Commands were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to after Generations or Ages.</p>
               <p>But some object, Christ did give a command to worke Miracles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.8. heal the sick, &amp;c. I answer, It was their gift at that time, therefore it is said, <hi>He gave them power over uncleau spirits, &amp;c.</hi> And the Text telleth us plainly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.1. <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.1. He gave POWER, and then commanded them to heal, &amp;c.
<note place="margin">w <hi>And it was but a command to use that power that he had given them.</hi>
                  </note> but where he restraineth that power, it cannot be done; but that hindereth not, but the Saints may do that which God hath given them power to do, and which lyeth in the Commission, to Preach and Baptise; Nay, it sheweth they ought.</p>
               <p>But why then doe they not goe preach to all Nations, according to the Commission? I Answer, because they have not power <hi>(i.e.)</hi> the gift of Tongues; for Christ bids them tarry at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> till they were indued with power from on high, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. which was speaking with Tongues, as appeareth <hi>Acts</hi> 2. But in the meane time they socia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, prayed to the Lord, instructed one another, made choice of an Apostle, as <hi>Acts</hi> 1. So may we meet together, seek the Lord, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct one another, choose Church-Officers, carry on Ordinances in our owne Country, though we have not the gift of Tongues to go to other Nations.</p>
               <p>Again consider, He promiseth his presence with them upon their performance of this, in their preaching and baptising, &amp;c. But he hath been with others in preaching the Gospel since the Age of gifts: If not, where is the promise that any man preaching may expect Christs presence? If not, why doe they preach till they have such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise?</p>

               <p>In the Doctrine of Baptismes Page 14. is this saying, <q>In <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. Christ leadeth his Disciples from <hi>Johns</hi> Baptisme to his own; as if he should say, <hi>John</hi> indeed baptised with water, and ye have hitherto used his Baptisme; but I shall now shortly baptise you with my owne Baptisme the Spirit; and from that time I would have you goe teach all Nations,</q> (here Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh,</hi> and he differeth, I would have you goe teach, And I teach, are two things) <q>and by the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:165581:8"/>ministration of the Spirit, not baptise them, or dip them into cold water (as <hi>John</hi> did in his own Baptisme, and you in his) but baptise them, or dip them into the name of God, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; and note that he saith not here in the Name, but into the Name, &amp;c. And by the Name of God is meant the Power or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of God, or God himselfe; as <hi>Marke</hi> 16. saith Christ, <hi>In my Name they shall cast out Devils;</hi> that is in my Power and Vertue. So that the sense lyeth thus, Teach the Nations and baptise them into the Name, &amp;c. That is, by your Ministery which shall be of the Spirit, and not of the letter; you shall baptise them, or dip them, or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest them, into the Name of God, who is Father, Son, and Spirit; as he hath discovered himself in his last and most glorious disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of himselfe in the Gospel; you shall I say, dip them into the Name, or sprinkle his Name upon them, that they may be Holy, Just, True, Mercifull, Righteous, Good, &amp;c.

Now whether men wil beleeve Scripture Interpretation or mans Interpretation, I leave it to the reader. And he, and M <hi>Saltmarsh,</hi> both con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fesse

               <p n="3">3. By the Name of God in the New Testament is meant very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Gospel, and the profession thereof; profession of Faith in God and Christ, and obedience to God &amp; Christ: This is proved at large in my Answer to the 6 Exception to Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh,</hi> whither I referre the Reader; so that notwithstanding all this, it standeth good, that <hi>Mat.</hi> 28 is meant of Baptisme by water, so that into his Name, is into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of faith in him, and obedience to him.</p>
               <p n="4">4 He saith, <hi>Paul</hi> baptised but few with water; but many of those that beleeved, yea all those mentioned at Corinth, were baptised by some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Disciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.8. so that the thing was done. Besides, that <hi>Paul</hi> baptised none in the countries,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 20.30.</note> kingdomes, villages, people, as he affirmeth, he cannot prove; all that was done was not written, but so much as is necessary for faith and obedience.</p>
               <p>But he saith, pag. 15. <hi>Paul</hi> baptised them into the name of God; he meaneth in his owne sense sure, for if he meane into the profession of the name of God, I say so too; if he meane into God, or the vertue of God; I say, that was never in <hi>Pauls</hi> commission, nor any Mans: But he giveth no Scripture proofe for it at all, therefore I cannot beleeve it; I am not to thinke of man above what is written, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8. And he saith, <hi>Paul</hi> planted many Churches who never were washed at all with water baptisine, but proveth it not; for what if water baptisme be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies named? <hi>Paul</hi> taught them, obedience and water baptisme is commanded. But you see, these men that condemne others for using consequences, their strongest argument against ordinances, are but meere consequences.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Marke</hi> maketh it cleare, it is to continue as long as preaching, and as long as beleeving; the one is of as large an extent as the other, <hi>Mar,</hi> 16.15, 16. now by the same reason they deny Baptisme, they may deny preaching of the Gospel; and so we shall have neither faith, nor Christ, nor life, nor holinesse; down-right Atheisme presently.</p>

So that you see, it is the minde of Christ this ordinance should be practised by his Churches. Now <hi>Paul</hi> received it of the Lord, not while Christ was in the flesh upon earth (for he was ascended before <hi>Paul</hi> was converted) but by revelation from Heaven,
<note place="margin">Gal. 1.1 Eph. 3.3</note> as he received the Gospel, this being part of it. Now if Christ would have outward ordinances to cease, and not to be used by his people; it is a wonder he would reveale such a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, externall thing, such a shadow, a peice of flesh to <hi>Paul</hi> after his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scention, and that such things were nailed to his Crosse (as they say)
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:165581:9"/>and that <hi>Paul</hi> should so beat it upon them againe in respect of the right use, when they abused it; and not rather tell them of the abolition of it. Which things considered, sheweth it is an ordinance of Christ to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. But if you looke to the 26. Verse, it cleareth up the continuance of it; <hi>As often as ye eate this Bread, and drinke this Cup, ye doe shew forth</hi> (or shew ye forth) <hi>the Lords death till be come.</hi> Where you see, he would have them observe it, till the comming of Christ, or the Lord.

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But Preaching was before Christ, therefore that is to continue.</p>
               <p>I answer; 1. That followeth not, for divers things that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ are not to continue; Circumcision was before Christ, yet it is not to continue; and if this reason hold good, some of them say, Baptisme was before Christ, for it is of the Law, say they; now that which is of the Law, was before Christ: therefore by their owne argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that must continue also.</p>
               <p n="2">2 I say, preaching the Gospell to all Nations, to every creature under Heaven, was not before Christ, nor after Christs revealing in the flesh for a time; and if they preach the Gospell from example, or command before Christ, then they must get them to the Family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to that people,

               <p>But some say, To use prayer in society by word,
<note place="margin">That the Saints are to pray by words, cleared.</note> is but an invention of man. I answer; The Scripture commandeth prayer by word, when the Church meeteth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1.

That this is in publicke assemblies appeareth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he giveth him order in the Epistle concerning their publick mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and Officers, and Doctrine to be taught in the former Chapter; and sheweth, Chap. 1.3. the cause why he left him at Ephesus was, to charge some that they teach no other doctrine; and therefore he speakes of their meetings. And did not <hi>Paul</hi> pray by word in an assembly? <hi>Act.</hi> 20 36. <hi>He kneeled downe and prayed WITH them all, and they all wept sore, &amp;c.</hi> It seemeth he spake words that they understood.

<note place="margin">Mat. 26.44.</note> but <hi>Davids</hi> prayers which he calleth formes, and that prayer Christ taught his Disciples, and Christ repeating the same words.

               <p>He saith, <q>speaking not by a forme, in a conceived extempory way, is taken by Christians to be prayer in Spirit; when it is but the brea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">No prayer but extemporary in Spirit, answered.</note> it is but reason, &amp;c. but there may be the Spirit, and yet the manifestation of the Spirit may be wanting. <hi>David</hi> wanted the manifestation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, when he cryed, <hi>I am cast out of thy sight,</hi> Psal. 31.22. yet God heard his voyce in mercy, and loving kindnesse, and he had the Spirit at that time.

               <p n="5">5 As a man may pray three or foure houres upon the account of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, memory, affection, &amp;c. so a man may preach as long upon the same account, and not be Spiriruall preaching, nor according to truth, by the same reason; and yet all their preaching extempore they say is by the Spirit. But it is good for people to search the Scripture, like the Noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> to see if these things be so, and to try the Spirits, whether they be of God; and may not such preachings by wit, and reason, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and memory, that are not by the pure Spirit, be as bad as study, and helps otherwise? And upon that account many of them preach, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they say, they are not infallible; then it is not upon the account of the Spirit; for that is infallible so farre as it worketh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But some say, All is to be carried on, and done in Spirit, and outward ordinances are nothing; They are but shadowes, and when the substance is come, what should wee doe with the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow?</p>
               <p>I say,
<note place="margin">That outward ordinances are shadowes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</note> All is to be carried on in Spirit, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> according to the rule of the Spirit, and Scripture, which was given by Divine inspiration, and things done without the Spirit of God are nothing; these indeed are but shadowes. But consider well, the Scripture never calleth any ordinance a shadow, carnall, or flesh till they be ended, and abolished; that God hath left them a Carcase without a Spirit. So the ordinances of the Law are called shadowes being abolished, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8.5, &amp; 10.1. And <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.17. with reference to Gospell times; all which speake of the shadowes of the Law, and nothing of any Gospell ordinance, as the places are cleare. So <hi>Paul</hi> calleth his Circumcision, and birth of Israel, and of the tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and zeale, and blamelesse legall walking, <hi>Fhil.</hi> 3. flesh: But it was when these were made nothing, by Christs comming in the flesh; they are not so called in the Old Testament, whilst they remained institutions in force. And so the ordinances of the first Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle are called, Carnall, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. but never till they were abolished; and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:165581:11"/>let any man shew me by Scripture where these Ordinances that I plead for, are abolished, and then I will yeeld to them.</p>
               <p>And if outward Ordinances are ceased upon this ground,

Then our assembling together in outward so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety must cease also, it is communion in spirit, we need never see one anothers faces; but that is false, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Not forsaking the assembling of our selves together as the manner of some is, but EXHORT one another daily;</hi> Then works of Mercy, distribution to the necessities of the Saints must be in Spirit, pity them in Spirit, mourn over them in Spirit: Nay let the Spirit supply their wants: To give them money, or victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, or rayment, are but carnall, outward things, that perish with the using: Distribution must be carried on only in Spirit. Then the written Scripture must cease; for writing is an outward Ordinance, Paper and Inke are but carnall things, shadows, flesh: It must be written in the heart by the Spirit; what should we doe with writings seen to the eye? &amp;c. And so some of them plead; some say the Scripture is nothing to them; others say they would not make use of the Letter, but onely to stoop to the weake: And so some of them say all these things are ceased.</p>

               <p>Nay, see if it do not clearly take off obedience to Magistrates, and throw downe Magistracy; for Magistracy is an outward Ordinance, Obey Magistrates <hi>(i e.)</hi> in Civill things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. for this cause pay we tribute; why this is but outward, Christ is our King, and we ought to obey him in Spirit onely.

And yet the Scripture holdeth forth directly obedience to Magistrates; To the King as supream, or those that be appointed by him, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14.</p>

               <p>And I shall prove <hi>Johns</hi> a Gospell Ministery, by two Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Because if <hi>Johns</hi> Baptisme had beene of the Law, the Scribes and Pharisees, and Elders would have received it; for they were zealous of the Law and of Traditions; as <hi>Paul</hi> confesseth when he was a Pharisee, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. They would not have made it so strange as they did, <hi>John</hi> 1.19. The Jewes sent Priests and Levites (and these were of the Pharisees too, Ver. 24. and well versed in the Law) to <hi>John</hi> to aske him, <hi>Who art thou?</hi> And when he denied to be <hi>Christ</hi> or <hi>Elias,</hi> or that Prophet; they aske him thus, <hi>Why baptisest thou then, if thou he not the Christ, &amp;c.</hi> Shewing that <hi>Johns</hi> Baptisme was a new thing, and not a legall washing; for if so it might have been done by other persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side <hi>Christ,</hi> or <hi>Elias,</hi> or that Prophet; even by the Priests and Levites, as the legall washings were, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. Therefore it was of the Gospell, it could not have been so strange to men experienced in the Law else. And Doctrine of Baptismes, Page 7. confesseth, <hi>Johns</hi> Baptisme was brought in beside the Ceremonies and Rites of the Law (then it was of the Gospell fare:) therefore a signe of a great change.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Because Christ reproveth the people, for not yeelding to <hi>Johns</hi> Doctrine and practice; and that very sharply, <hi>Mar.</hi> 11.30, 31. Christ asked a Question, <hi>The baptisme of John, was it from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say from heaven, he will say, why then did ye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ot beleeve him?</hi> Why, they knew the Law was from heaven <hi>John</hi> 9. We know God spake to <hi>Moses;</hi> They beleeved that and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it; but they were averse to <hi>Iohns</hi> Doctrine and practice, yea to his Baptisme; which sheweth this was not of the Law, but of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But Baptisme with water was before the death of Christ, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is of the Law. By that Reason, I may argue, the Supper was before the death of Christ, therefore it is of the Law. But that is not so, <hi>Paul</hi> delivered it as the minde of God to the Corinthians, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him after Christs Ascension; and putteth it among the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the Lord, that he wrote unto them. And so preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was before the death of Christ, therefore it is of the Law; but this reasoning will not hold.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Salm.</hi> first reason why it was legall is,
<note place="margin">Johns <hi>Baptisme legall, because administred by persons of more then ordinary gift, answered.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <q>Because it was alwayes administred (saith he) by persons of more then ordinary gift, or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; by men that were properly, and specially, and extraordinarily enabled for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat Office or Administration: As the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> for Ordinances of the Law, <hi>Abraham</hi> for Circumcision, &amp;c. for so all legall Ordinances were.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 I ask, what extraordinary gift, or spirit had the Levites? but onely
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:165581:14"/>they were designed of God to that Office; so is a Disciple able to preach the Gospel to this, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19.</p>
               <p n="2">2 What extraordinary gift or spirit had <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 15.28. Mat. 8.10.</note> to enable him for Circumcision, that can be made out by Scripture? He is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for his faith; so is the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Centurion; yea for great faith, and greater then any God found in <hi>Israel:</hi> Then it will follow, that one that hath the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> may baptise with water, because <hi>Abraham</hi> did circumcise.</p>
               <p n="3">3 If the Scripture doe make record of none that did baptise with water, but some that had some extraordinary gift or spirit; how will it appeare that others may not doe it? where doth God tye the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Ordinances by any Scripture to men of extraordinary gifts, as he tyed the administration of legall Ordinances to Priests and Levites? Did not God give Plaine directions who should admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister?
<note place="margin">Exod. 28.1 <hi>And elsewhere.</hi>
                  </note> shew us such a direction in this kinde, and it will satisfie. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side I aske, what extraordinary gift or spirit had <hi>John Baptist?</hi> He did no miracle, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.41. <q>But he was more then a Prophet,</q> saith he. I, and the Scripture saith, <hi>He that is least in the Kingdome of heaven, is greater then he;</hi> therefore by that reason, hath as proper and speciall a call to do that, as he.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Consider, if this do not hold in Preaching as well as Baptisme, where did any preach under the Law, or in Christs time, or the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, but such as were properly and specially gifted or spirited for it? Therefore those that have no power to baptise, have none to preach: And how can Mr. <hi>Saltm</hi> call himselfe a Preacher of the Gospel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an extraordinary speciall gift? And if he had this, why did he not baptise with water? Was not preaching administred either by the Priests or Prophets, or men of more then ordinary gift or calling: And so were the Apostles, and Disciples of Christ, the twelve, the seventy, <hi>John Baptist,</hi> who preached, and were sent forth to preach.</p>
               <p>I will onely repeat his words, and where he puts baptising, I will adde preaching all along, intreating the Reader to read once for him, with the word Baptising: And once for me, with the word Preaching: And so leave him to judge whether his pleading be not as strong against the one, as the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Nor is there any extant in all the New Testament, who did (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister Baptisme) (PREACH) but they were such as by a Power and gift, more then ordinary, could make demonstration of their calling to the administration of (water) (PREACHING) which was first in the way of Doctrine performed by him, then whom a greater Prophet hath not risen, even by <hi>John,</hi> who (Baptised) (PREACH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED:) And so <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Ananias;</hi> the one working glorious Miracles in <hi>Samaria:</hi> the other had a vision, to warrant and glorifie his call to the (Administration) (PREACHING) (upon) (UNTO) <hi>Paul;</hi> and so all the Apostles, and seventy Disciples, were men that went
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:165581:14"/>about doing Miracles, as men excellently gifted for (administration:) (PREACHING:)</q> (And mark it, he cannot prove that either the twelve or seventy, went about baptising in their first sending out, and yet they worked miracles, which sheweth it rather giveth them right to preach, then baptise; and indeed they were to confirme the word, and not to confirme administration of Baptisme with water, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. <hi>ult. Heb.</hi> 2.4.) <q>And as the Scripture maketh mention of some Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as those with <hi>Peter,</hi> who did not appear to doe any thing more then others; Nor <hi>Phillip,</hi> nor <hi>Ananias,</hi> at the time of their Administration of (water;) (PREACHING) it ought to be sufficient to us, that the Scripture doth set forth <hi>John Baptist.</hi>
                  </q> (Yet he did no miracle at all; and what extraordinary gift he had, Mr. <hi>Saltm.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 10.41.</note> hath not yet proved by Scripture;) <q>and the Apostles and Disciples, that were more then ordinarily gifted; and <hi>Phillip</hi> and <hi>Ananias,</hi> who had sufficient warrant to themselves, by such glory upon them, for the Office, and Administration of (Water) (PREACHING) (upon) (UNTO) any; And for those other Disciples, surely we read enough to tell us in those that are so gifted; and in them, and their gifts, there is light enough to shew us the glory of those (Baptists;) (PREACHERS) that did undertake to (Administer) (PREACH) which in the Scripture method, is sufficient for all others, of whom the Scripture is silent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So that you see upon the same ground, and as firme ground we shall overthrow all preaching of the Gospell, because men want those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gifts. But he saith indeed, <q>No man can reach now, or preach according to the Commission.</q> I wonder then by what power, or authority, either he or any other man preached without Commission? Then they are false Prophets, ran, and he sent them not,
<note place="margin">Jer. 23.22.32.</note> and so never profit the people they preach to; for they cannot be Instruments to beget faith, except they be sent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14,</p>
               <p n="5">5 By this manner of arguing, I would know how it will be proved that any beleeved but such as had extraordinary gifts; according to that promise, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.17. These signes shall follow those that beleeve, &amp;c. And repent and be baptised, &amp;c. and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, which were those gifts, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. So that we may as well reason against Faith as Baptisme: for by this reason beleeving may as well be ceased, as Churches, and Ordinances: They say, if we wil have a Visible Church, and outward Ordinances, where are those gifts that they had then? I say, If they will have beleevers, true beleevers, as was in the Apostles times; where are the gifts that were promised, and they had then? <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.37, 38.</p>
               <p>To that, That <hi>Johns</hi> Ministery was unto Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. I answer, The Scripture saith not so, but unto Repentance; And Repentance is to be preached as universally as the Gospel, to every man, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30. And it is a principle among the Doctrines of Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. So that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:165581:15"/>
                  <hi>Johns</hi> Ministery was a Gospell Ministery, to continue in that respect, and so his Baptisme.</p>
               <p>To that he saith, <q>It was reckoned among things that are legall, <hi>Heb</hi> 9.</q> I answer, Though he say the word washing in the Greek, is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, there in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. Yet <hi>Johns</hi> Baptisme is not there meant; for that is of the Gospel, as I have shewed: And those washings were not such as were strange to the Priests and Pharisees, but used by them, as appeareth by that place: But <hi>Iohns</hi> was not so. Besides those washings were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue till the time of Reformation, and that was till <hi>Iohn,</hi> as well as untill Christ; For <hi>Iohn</hi> came in the Spirit, and power of <hi>Elias,</hi> to turne the hearts of the Children to the Parents, &amp;c. Therefore <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptisme cannot be here meant.</p>
               <p>To that that <hi>Johns</hi> Ministery was upon the account of the Law, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. I answer, That Scripture proveth no such thing; though <hi>Iohn</hi> could not tell the people, that Christ had suffered, and was risen, and ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp;c. as those afterward could tell them; therefore greater then <hi>Iohn.</hi>

                  </gap> the Doctrine of Baptismes, Page 16. I say, the Disciples of Christ did not baptise, because it was an honourable Ceremony, as some of them circumcised. None circumcised but <hi>Paul;</hi> and there is speciall reason given for it, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.2. Because of the Jews in those quarters, for they all knew that his Father was a Greek. So that <hi>Paul</hi> would not have circumcised <hi>Timothy</hi> if there had not been Jewes in those parts, and if <hi>Timothies</hi> Father had not been a Greek; not because it was an honourable Ceremony. Neither did he ever command Circumcision but preached it downe: But <hi>Peter</hi> commanded Baptisme with water, and none of them ever p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To that which he saith, they baptised upon <hi>Iohns</hi> account, Page 82. I answer, 1 Then they did it upon a Gospell account, for he was a Gospell Minister, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.1. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2 He giveth neither Scripture, nor reason for it, except these,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Because Christ baptised none, but his Disciples. I answer, what if Christ baptised none with his owne hands, his Disciples did it in his presence, by his Commission, as appeareth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.22. And that is all one, as if he had done it himselfe, <hi>Act.</hi> 7 47. It is said, <hi>Solomon</hi> built God an House, yet he neither bare burthen, nor laid stone; but he caused it to be done. So it was in this case. And <hi>Iohns</hi> Disciples make it clear, Ver. 26. for say they, <hi>Master, he that was with thee beyond Iordan, to whom thou bearest witnesse, baptiseth, and all men come to him</hi> They did not say he helpeth thee; but he baptiseth and they flock after him.</p>

<note place="margin">Jonah 3.4. <hi>with</hi> 4.9.</note> We must learne to distinguish between a Prophets or Apostles Doctrine, and actions; <hi>Ionahs</hi> Doctrine was truth, but his passion was not his Spirituall liberty.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It is strange, that because he was the Apostle of the Circumcision, or to Israel, therefore he was under more bondage to outward things then others. Doth not Christ promise, that when the Spirit of truth is come,

<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.17.

               <p>And what of that? had he not a Vision? and if it were not the minde of God, could he not have revealed it in the Vision?

And what I have here said may serve for a full answer to his second Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Master <hi>Knollis,</hi> yet I shall touch at two things there, pag. 328.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That Christs Disciples baptised with water in <hi>Iohns</hi> Ministery, partly in honour to <hi>Iohns</hi> Ministery, I answer; That Scripture, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. sheweth otherwise, for <hi>Iohn</hi> (when some told him, Christ baptised, and all men came to him) saith, I must decrease, and he must increase; <hi>Yee your selves beare me witnesse, I said, I am not the Christ, &amp;c.</hi> so that was in honour to Christ, and not to <hi>Iohn.</hi>

               <p n="2">2 If it had not been the minde of Christ, one would have thought those immediatly inspired should have refused it, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. Those that had received the Holy Ghost, those extraordinary gifts, sure these were not weake; and yet these are commanded to be baptised with water. Nay then had <hi>Philip</hi> sinned in preaching it to the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. But some may say; It may be he did not preach it to him; I answer, if he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched it to him, it sheweth it to be a truth; and if God revealed it to him by immediate revelation, it sheweth clearly it was the minde of God, and not a Iewish shadow.</p>
               <p n="3">3 We finde they did circumcise, and observe things of the Law, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way upon some speciall reason, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.3. &amp; 21.20. but they never commanded any such thing, nor pressed men to it, as they did to Baptism with water; and the Apostles commandements were Christs comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.37.</p>

               <p n="2">2 <hi>Paul</hi> was more Jewish after his conversion, as appeareth by his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying himselfe, and circumcising, &amp;c. which others did not.</p>

               <p n="2">2 That Christ hath promised his presence to none that preach, and baptise, except they were infallible men; for upon this, that they goe and teach, and baptise, he promiseth; <hi>And loe,</hi> I <hi>am with you alway.</hi> And none can teach now, say some of them; none can preach infallibly, say all: then there is no expectation of Christs presence, and then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that none of these men have any of Christs presence with them in their preaching. So that by their owne doctrine, they doe deliver Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their owne hearts, and not the minde of Christ; then how can they be beleeved when they say, it is of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Then none can now beleeve, because none can so preach as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get faith, or not preach at all; for when preaching ceaseth faith must cease; for faith commeth by hearing the Word preached, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14.17. For there have bin no preachers say some, no infallible men that preach by commission saith another, since the Apostles age, but that is not so; for there have been beleevers in all ages, as I have proved at large before; therefore there have been preachers in all ages, yet not infallible men.</p>

               <p>Master <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 40. <q>It is the Apostles drift in Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians 2. to take us higher then Rudiments, which perish with the using.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, I would faine have him shew me where any New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ordinance is called, a Rudiment? for there he laboureth to take them off from legall ordinances.</p>
               <p n="2">2 I would know, whether the Scriptures written with Paper and Inke, be not as meare a Rudiment, as the Word written in stone? And yet one is taken away in respect of the manner of writing; Doth not this tend to the over-throw of all the Scripture?</p>
               <p n="3">3 Those Rudiments are, and are joyned with traditions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of men: And so are not the ordinances that Christ, and his Apostles instituted, or commanded.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Pag. 83. Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> saith, he beleeveth, as the Iewish Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies wore out by degrees, so did <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme by Christs of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; (I must decrease, but he must increase) which surely was spoken not according to the persons of <hi>Iohn</hi> and Christ, but according to their ministration; which was the great thing the Scripture taketh notice of. And Doctrine of Baptismes, <hi>pag.</hi> 17. He must increase, but I must decrease; in which <hi>Iohn</hi> intimateth, that the Spirit, or fire Baptisme, would by degrees eate up water baptisme; the truth must eate out the Ceremony, and the substance, the signe; And the more his Ministery and Baptisme commeth in, the more mine must goe out, &amp;c. And saith Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh,</hi> pag. 60. As in that figure of the Sacrifice, performed by <hi>Elijah</hi> the Prophet, when the fire came downe, and sucked up the foure Barrels of water, so doth fire Baptisme, suck up water Baptisme.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is another Reason, to prove Baptisme with water Jewish, it seemeth by Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> his Booke; but we shall finde it no reason at all
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:165581:20"/>for it is not so out of doubt (as he saith) that <hi>Iohn</hi> spake of that part of his Ministery,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Another reason whereby they would prove Baptisme with water Jewish, is, because Christs Baptisme of fire did eate up, or wear out</hi> Iohns, <hi>he must increase, I must decrease, answered.</hi>
                  </note> that was his washing or baptisme; The Scripture saith not so, nor any circumstance that clearly holdeth out such a thing: And if the question was about Christs and <hi>Iohns</hi> Ministration, why did not preaching Faith and Repentance, weare out as a Iewish Ceremony, as well as baptisme with water? for that was <hi>Iohns</hi> Ministration as well as the other. Why doth not casting down Mountaines, and raising up Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, to make the way of the Lord strait, weare out; for that was <hi>Iohns</hi> Ministration. And yet that continueth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. casting down im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But I thinke if the Scripture be looked well into, the meaning will appeare to be thus. There came some to <hi>Iohn,</hi> that seemed to be troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that so many flocked after Christ; insomuch that (it should seeme) <hi>Iohn</hi> was not in the same estimation now, as he was formerly; (for all held <hi>Iohn</hi> as a Prophet) But now they flock after Christ, and neglect <hi>Iohn, Joh.</hi> 3.26. wherefore they thought that <hi>Iohns</hi> reputation would goe downe; as <hi>Ioshua</hi> did concerning <hi>Moses,</hi> when <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied in the Camp;
<note place="margin">Num. 11.28</note>) <hi>Iohns</hi> answer importeth this, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.27. for saith he, <hi>A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven;</hi> As if he should say, He hath received it from Heaven, to draw men after him, and not so much to flock to me; yee your selves beare me witnesse, I said, I am not the Christ; ye thinke highly of me, and thinke none should be esteemed above me; But I ever denyed that I was the Christ, and he that is Christ is to have the preheminence. He that hath the Bride, is the Bride-groom; But the friend of the Bride-groom which standeth &amp; hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Bride-grooms voyce, rejoyceth; this my joy therefore is fulfilled. As if he should say, He is the Bride-groom, I am but his friend: and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce that he hath the Bride, that men gather to him; He must increase, but I must decrease; <hi>(i.e.)</hi> he must be more highly esteemed, and I must be lesse esteemed. Men have looked upon me as a Prophet, and questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned whether I was the Christ or no, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.19, 20. It will appeare now that he is the Christ, and so they shall gather to him more then to me: And they shall see, that he is more Excellent then I, which hath scarce yet appeared: And so he goeth on to set forth Christs excellency, to perswade with them to follow Christ, in the latter end of the Chapter, as he did with his two Disciples, <hi>John</hi> 1.36, 37, 38. <hi>Behold the Lambe of God,</hi> to occasion his Disciples to goe after him, and they did so; and yet not flight the Baptisme of <hi>John</hi> neither, in regard of the excellency of his person, and office, above <hi>Johns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 I would faine have him prove, that the fire sucking up the Barrels of water, was a figure of the Baptisme of fire, which was to lick up that of water: where doth the Scripture shew it was a Figure of any such thing?

               <p n="4">4 I would aske, what is meant by SPIRIT and TRUTH; whether a mans own spirit, or Gods Spirit?</p>

               <p>If any say, the Spirit of God within a man, or that his spirit should
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:165581:21"/>be with God when he worshippeth: I say, that was required then as well as now, 1 <hi>Sam,</hi> 12.24. <hi>Josh.</hi> 24.13. There is Spirit and Truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, yet that tooke them not off from observing legall Ordinances then; No more doth worshipping God in Spirit and Truth, take the Saints off from observing Gospell Ordinances now: as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.9. He served God in his Spirit, in the Gospell of his Son; and yet this man preached, and conferred, and prayed by word, and brake bread, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. And was baptised with water.</p>
               <p>If it be in Spirit, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> the Spirit of God; Then I would ask, whether the Spirit of God doe not speak in Scripture, as well as in these mens hearts, and tongues; seeing they say, They are not infallible? <hi>Did not holy men of God speak as they were moved by the Holy Ghost?</hi> 2 Pet. 1.21, Doth not Christ say, <hi>The words that I speake unto you, they are Spirit, and they are life, John</hi> 6. And <hi>Stephen</hi> calleth this the Holy Ghost, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51, 52. And <hi>Peter</hi> calleth the word in the Ministery of <hi>Noah,</hi> the Spirit of Christ, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. Now then, those that worship God according to his word in the New Testament, in such Ordinances as the word holdeth forth; worship God in Spirit, in regard of the matter of worship: And such the Father seeketh to worship him.</p>
               <p>And so he worshippeth God in Truth, that worshippeth not onely from true principles of Christ, who is Truth; In that Truth: But worshippeth according to his word. For saith he, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. <hi>My mouth shall speake Truth;</hi> Truth, in opposition to perversnesse.</p>

               <p n="1">1 He is in, the Desart: The Church (say they) is in the wildernesse, And not yet made Visible; And we are to be fed from inspirations and spirit from Christ alone, and no Ordinance to be made use of. What
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:165581:21"/>is this, but to be in the Desart where Israel was, where was no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fruits to sustaine them in a way of ordinary providence, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary; Manna from Heaven, &amp;c. God is not seen, nor enjoyed in any Ordinance, but immediately from himselfe; his Church is in the Wildernesse, or Desart; and he is in his Church, and there you must have him. But saith Christ, <hi>Goe not forth, Mat.</hi> 24.26. <hi>(i.e.)</hi> forth of your Order, and Ordinances, and Obedience; neither to the Seekers; nor those others, to seek Christ in the Desart.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In the Secret Chambers; that is, saith Mr. <hi>Salt.</hi> Single fellowships. See how contrary to Scripture this is, was not Christ in the Single fellowships of particular Churches in the Apostles times? Did he not say he would dwell in the Corinthians, and yet a Single fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, called out from the world, and Idolaters? And was in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of the seven Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> Single fellowships. 2. Apply this to others which say, Christ is in the Chambers;
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.16. Rev. 1.13.</note> All within in heart and spirit secretly; he is not openly seen in Ordinances now, but privately enjoyed between God and a mans owne soul, in spirit onely. Is not this to have him in the Secret Chambers? But saith Christ, Beleeve it not. And the next words, <hi>Ver.</hi> 27. shew, that Christs comming (if it be in Spirit) is made apparent, visible, like the lightening that shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; and is not kept close within, as they say. And so <hi>Ver.</hi> 28. maketh for gathering together into Visible fellowships. And marke it, He bringeth no Scripture to prove that by Secret Chambers, are meant Single fellowships; But the Scripture calleth the inward parts of man Chambers. The words of a Tale bearer are as wounds,

So that, he is in the CHAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERS <hi>(i.e.)</hi> he is all within in heart, and spirit; Beleeve it not, saith Christ. To that, that he saith, Chambers is an upper room, and the Seekers conceive their fellowship an upper room to Presbytery, &amp;c. I answer, I am sure THEY themselves doe so for the generall, cry out, that those that use Ordinances, are low, and weake, they are not yet come to those high enjoyments as they are; So that by their owne, description, they are the men that cry, he is in the Secret Chambers private; as a Chamber in a Chamber, according to Scripture.</p>

               <p n="3">3 I would aske, whether he that rejoyceth that the Word of God goeth forward, and others walke in the Truth, doe not rejoyce in the Holy Ghost, as well as he that rejoyceth in his owne feelings and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances? according to 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3, 4.</p>
               <p n="4">4 I affirme, in some sence, The Kingdome of God doth consist in meat and drinke, in these outward things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32 <hi>Whether yee eate or drinke, or whatsoever you doe, doe all to the glory of God.</hi> Now, the glory of God is part of his Kingdome, and <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>If meat make my brother to offend, I will eate no meat while the world standeth, rather then my brother shall offend,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. <hi>ult.</hi>

               <p n="5">5 Consider, whether by this Argument, preaching, and conference, and instruction, and words of prayer, and praise, and confessing of Gods goodnesse, and Christs love, and witnessing to God, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our Judgements, our Experiences, &amp;c. be not as cleerly taken off, as other ordinances, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.20. saith the Apostle, <hi>The Kingdome of God standeth not in WORD, but in power.</hi> You see, there is as little of the Kingdome of God in word, as in meat and drinke. Why doe they use any words at all, concerning God, or Christ, or the Gospell, seeing it standeth not in word, but in power? And their word is not power upon mens hearts, as Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> confesseth; And yet any man may see, the preaching of the Gospell is called, the WORD of the KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOME, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.19.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And therefore, the meaning must be, The Kingdome of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth not only, or principally in these, either in word, or meat, and drinke, &amp;c. as <hi>John</hi> 12. <hi>He that beleeveth on me, beleeveth not on me, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) not only; And, <hi>Labour not for the meat that perisheth, (i. e.)</hi> only, or principally; so it is here.</p>

               <p>I answer; Is not his preaching, or the writing this Booke signes and ceremonies, and so no part of the Kingdome of Christ? Nay, doth not this make directly against the Scripture? for what are the Letters, and Sillables, but signes of Spirituall things contained in them, or under them? So that by this tenet, the Scriptures themselves are no part of Righteousnesse, or of the Kingdome of Christ; if rightly understood: But that is false; for therein is the Law of Christ revealed contained, and the minde of God set downe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Then not these mens preachings, or testifying to God; for that is outward, and but outward: Nay, <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching was not of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, it seemeth; for that was outward.

               </p>
               <p>I answer; a Ceremony is a command of God, to be observed in its time; so that Faith, without any worke at all to appeare before men. And the Spirit without any fruit to appeare before men, is suffi<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">

And that within you, is among you also: for it was not within the Scribes and Pharisees that opposed Christ, no otherwise then among them; the Saints being among them: for it is spoken to them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.20, 21.</p>

               <p>Heaven and Earth shook at the destruction of <hi>Babilon, Isa</hi> 13.13. And Heaven and Earth shook at the death of Christ. The Earth quaked, and the vaile of the Temple was rent: And so the Holy of Holies

But you will say these are holy things; Holy Ordinances, HOLY SCRIPTURES, Holy prayer, Holy FAITH; These are the HOLY CITY of God; TRUE, and yet all these things are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Gentiles, to be trampled upon: And trodden under foot.

               <p>A very likely Exposition; They shall runne to that which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, and from it, and knowledge shall be increased. This is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of knowledge in them, as it was in <hi>Adam;</hi> He obeyed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and ranne from the Command, and knowledge was increased. But marke, his running from, was Satans perswasion; and knowledge was increased to his sorrow,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.7, 8.</note>
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.5. So it is here, This perswasion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not of him that calleth us to runne forward, and then backward againe. That which was a cursed designe of Satan, to increase know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in running from Gods Command, can never be the way of the Spirit now.</p>
               <p>And therefore if we must take it in their sense; of Ordinances, it must needs mean false Ordinances of Antichrist, and the world; And so the Saints running to them, they know the vanity, the superstition, the emptinesse, the nothingnesse of them. And so by running from them againe: They cleave more to Christ, and partake more of Christ. Or else Ordinances of the Law,
<note place="margin">Rom. 14.2.</note> which many that were dead did runne to, And yet in time were taken off from them againe; But what is this to Ordinances of the Gospell.</p>
               <p>Again consider to runne to and fro, signifyeth not the forsaking of the thing utterly; but rather a searching into all particulars of the thing. So it is said, The Propet walked to and fro, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4 35. yet in the house still. It importeth no forsaking either side of the House, but his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting both sides; Therefore the Hebrew is once hither, and once thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; So <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.5. A Raven went to and fro, <hi>(i.e)</hi> in going and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning: That fro, or going, was not an utter forsaking, but a returning againe; signifying also a motion in the thing; So 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.9. <hi>The eyes of the Lord runne TO and FRO, through the earth, &amp;c.</hi> Doth it meane, his eyes runne to his people, and from his people? No; but he is in every place watching over all his people; it sheweth his care and watchfulnesse over all. So <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 27.19. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.9. If it should be Ordinances in their sense, it must needs mean the exercise of themselves in all Duties, Services, Word, Ordinances, and so knowledge is increased in all. But the sentence signifieth onely a
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:165581:25"/>Motion, as appeareth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. &amp; 2.2. A restlesse condition, <hi>Iob</hi> 7.4. <hi>Psal.</hi> 107.27. A thing in motion, <hi>Iob</hi> 13.25. <hi>Isa.</hi> 33.4 &amp; 49.21. <hi>Ier.</hi> 49.3. The Sentence (run to and fro) holdeth out two things. 1. Motion. 2. Motion in the same thing named.

               </p>
               <p>I answer; All those ones, are with respect to the unity of the Spirit, which he exhorteth them to keep; now in keeping the unity of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is the bond of peace, there is,</p>
               <p n="1">1 ONE Body, yet this hindered not but in visible order of walking,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:165581:26"/>there was at that time many Bodies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, they were the Body of Christ. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7. he saith, <hi>We being many are one body in Christ,</hi> speaking of the Romans that were Saints: The Ephesians were a Body, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.16. for the body was to be edified in love, by the members: now, no one member could edifie the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Body (except an Apostle by his writings;) but this Exhortation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth every particular member; therefore he meaneth such a body, where the members had communion so as they might edifie one another. The Scripture speaketh of such Bodies which had administrations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, which have in them, some to see, called, an Eye. Some to hear, called, the Eare. Some to administer, called, the Hand. Some to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, called, the Foot; which cannot be done in the generall, but in a particular body walking together; and yet all these are but one body in Christ, in the unity of the Spirit. So there were severall Bodies in Asia, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. and in <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1. and he himselfe confesseth particular Bodies, or Churches, <hi>pag.</hi> 306. yea and visible Churches, <hi>pag.</hi> 145. &amp; 175. yet all but one, in unity of the Spirit. So <hi>Paul</hi> calleth Christ, <hi>The Apostle of our profession,</hi> Hebr. 3.1. yet this hindered not the being of twelve Apostles in those times: And they are to be acknowledged Apostles of our Profession too. So that this arguing is but a sound without sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
               <p n="2">2 ONE SPIRIT in the unity of the Spirit; and yet this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth not, but there are seven Spirits also, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.4. And seven Spirits of God too, <hi>Revel.</hi> 4.5. There is a spirit of Adoption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of burning, <hi>Isa.</hi> 4.4. the Spirit of Christ, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. the spirit of Councell, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11.1. the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. the Spirit of Grace, and supplications, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. the spirit of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Isa.</hi> 4.4. the spirit of knowledge, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11.2. the spirit of life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.11. the Spirit of the Lord, the spirit of meeknesse, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.21. the Spirit of promise, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.13. the Spirit of Prophesie, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.10. the spirit of truth, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.6. the spirit of understanding, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11.2. the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of wisdome, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.17.

<note place="margin">Acts 23.6</note> To wait for a thing we expect, is called, Hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24. and this is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by experience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.4. therefore it is the grace of waiting, and not Christ himselfe; sometimes the Saints in the presence of the Lord at his comming, are said to be their brethrens hope, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.19, 20 yet all these three are one in unity of Spirit; and none of them ceased, because there is ONE hope of our calling.</p>
               <p n="4">4 ONE LORD. Why, saith the Apostle,
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> There are Lords ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yea and lawfull Lords too; Kings, Magistrates, Governours; yea the Husband is the Wives Lord, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6. yet all these but one in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of spirit; and none of them ceased because of this.</p>
               <p n="5">5 ONE FAITH; Faith is taken in severall acceptations, as sometimes for the Gospell, the word of the Gospell, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.23 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. &amp; 5.8. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.1. Sometimes the faith of God <hi>(i. e.)</hi> his Truth and Righteousnesse towards man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.3. sometimes a fruit of the Spirit, whereby a man receiveth Christ, and beleeveth on him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>The substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seene,</hi> Heb. 11.1. Sometimes to be convinced who is the Christ, is called, faith, or beleeving, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2 23, 24, 25. Sometimes the profession of him is called faith, as that of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Acts 8. &amp; <hi>John</hi> 6. There were many that did beleeve in profession, and did not beleeve in truth; the stony grounds profession is called, beleeving, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. And we are exhorted to hold fast the profession of our faith, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.23. And there is faith, that is receiving of Christ, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. And yet there is but one faith in the unity of the Spirit. There is faith, and the profession of faith, yet all these flow into one in unity of spirit.</p>
               <p n="6">6 There is ONE GOD, saith the Apostle, <hi>There are gods many,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8 Psal. 82</note> and lawfull gods too; <hi>I said, yee are gods;</hi> speaking of Magistrates: yet in unity of spirit but one God.</p>
               <p n="7">7 ONE FATHER, yet there be true reall Fathers upon earth,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12</note> that many of the Saints acknowledge, and honour; Fathers of our flesh; <hi>Honour thy father and mother.</hi> And those that beget them to the faith are called, their Fathers. So <hi>Paul</hi> calleth himselfe, the Corinthians father,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.2 Philemon 10.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. And calleth <hi>Timothy,</hi> his owne Sonne, and <hi>Onesimus,</hi> whom he begot in his bands; and yet but one father in unity of Spirit. But will all this, or any thing from this Scripture, prove that which Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> driveth at; That because there is one Baptisme, therefore baptisme with water is ceased? Did it prove, that baptisme of gifts was ceased, when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this? for he saith, there IS one Baptisme; he saith not, there shall be but one. And that of gifts was then in being, and that of water too; But they are all one in unity of spirit, being either administred by the Spirit, or revealed and Authorized, by the Spirit in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:165581:27"/>
               <p> Againe observe, he saith, there is one (he doth not say, there is BUT one) when he saith, there is one Body, doth he meane but one. There was the Body, the Church; there is the bodies of the Saints, which are the Temples of the Holy Ghost. He doth not say, which he meaneth there. There were then severall Bodies, or Societies of the Saints, there is one body, saith he; Doth he meane the visible Church at <hi>Corinth, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus, Galatia,</hi> the seven Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> were false Churches, or no Churches, or ceased now? Why then doth the Spirit in Scripture call them Churches? And if they were all true Churches, and yet but one Body then; And the severall Baptismes I named, all true; and yet but one Baptisme then: What hindereth that it may not bee so now?</p>
               <p>And when he saith there is one Spirit, doth he meane, the severall administrations, and operations, and gifts, and manifestations of the spirit were then ceased? Were not they the Spirit of Christ? Was the spirit of wisdome, and of a sound minde, and the spirit of promise, and spirit of Prophesie, &amp;c. false spirits, or ceased now? Truly no such thing, the Scripture speaketh contrary; and yet one Spirit.</p>
               <p>And when he saith, There is one hope of your calling, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Christ our hope; was the waitings of the Saints, and their expectations, yea and the Saints themselves nothing now? Were they abolished, ceased, a shadow, &amp;c? No such matter. Why, but this will follow upon as good reason as the other.</p>
               <p>And because he saith, <hi>There is one Lord,</hi> were Magistrates ceased? and Husbands ceased? And because he saith, <hi>There is one faith,</hi> was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospell ceased? Or conviction who is the Christ, or profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of him ceased? Or because there is one God, was Authority of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates ceased? And because there is one Father of all, were men, fathers of their children ceased? or begetting men to the faith ceased? But if these follow not, as they doe not; neither will it follow, That because there is one Baptisme, that therefore the Apostle must needs meane here there is but one; and the baptisme of water is ceased: or that the Saints are to acknowledge no more, or practise no more; for all the other will follow upon as good consequences as this, and this is but a consequence. But that would be a manifest falshood, if we should say it, and directly against the Scripture. Therefore so must the other be.</p>

                  <q>He saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 127. upon <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. That where it is said for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the Saints, &amp;c. It hath relation to the tenth Verse, that speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of Christ ascended, that he might fill all things; and this of the perfecting of the Saints is only an exposition, or interpretation of the tenth Verse in the worke of the Ministery, or the glorious and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all administration of himselfe upon his, and to bring them all into the unity of the faith, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, That he perfecteth the Saints, it is true: but the meanes by which he perfecteth them, is by the gifts he gave; and therefore
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:165581:27"/>they are to continue till we come to the unity of the faith, and not to cease; I meane the ordinary Pastors and Teachers.

And he saith againe, <hi>pag:</hi> 128, &amp; 129. none can perfect the Saints but Christ, not Apostles, &amp;c.

And so the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles are said to be workers with God. And so <hi>Paul</hi> telleth the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians he had begotten them,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4</note> meaning as an instrument in Gods hand. And so they may as well perfect, as beget. But this by the way, because I was answering an Objection grounded upon that Chapter.</p>
               <p>Some say, they waite for an Administrator, for a new command, as <hi>Joshua</hi> when he circumcised, after Circumcision had been neglected, <hi>Joshua</hi> 5. For a new institution to Baptise, and breake bread, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Answ. <hi>Ioshua</hi> did not waite for a new Institution to Circumcise,

                     <hi>That some waite for a new insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to Baptise, and breake Bread, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Wherein</hi> Josh. 5.2. <hi>&amp;c. is cleared.</hi>
                  </note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Circumcision had been corrupted, and lost; for it was not lost: for though they had not Circumcised after they came into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, yet there was Circumcised persons among them; <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and <hi>Caleb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 This was no new Institution, but onely a command, minding them of, and quickning them to their duty; and calling <hi>Ioshua</hi> to doe that which had been neglected: not an Institution to that which was not before. For that is an institution, when that is commanded that was not done before the first Command. And we must looke for no more new Commands, but what we finde in Scripture: for so saith the Lord, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 22. <hi>If any man adde to the words of the Prophesie of this Booke, God shall adde to him all the plagues written therein.</hi> But that Prophesie speaketh of no new commands, which were not then in force.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Circumcision was not lost through the over-spreading of Idolatry, Antichristianisme, Corruption; for if so, then it had been more likely to have been lost in Aegypt: But neglected for a time; therefore here was no new institution.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Circumcision was omitted upon a speciall reason, as may appeare; because they were in their travell, and journey; and while they were sore they were unfit to travell, as appeareth, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. And in their journey they were to wait upon the Lords motion, when the cloud removed, whether by day, or by night: Therefore till they were come to be setled in <hi>Canaan</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:165581:28"/>they omitted it, as being prejudiciall to their journey. This reason is clearly given (though some deny it) in the fifth and sixth Verses; they were not circumcised, for the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> walked sorty yeares in the Wildernesse, &amp;c. The reason why <hi>Ioshua</hi> Circumcised, is given, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were not Circumcised, from the dayes of Aegypt; the reason why they were not circumcised is given, their walking in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, their travailes and journey. So that when this speciall reason was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, that they were come into Canaan; then he Circumcised.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The case was not with them as it is with us, we have now a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word, the Scripture to be our rule; they had none but by tradition, or extraordinary revelation, till the Law was given upon Mount Sinai. And when God minded <hi>Moses</hi> of ordering and eating the Passeover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.44.48, &amp;c. he intimateth, That either the Passeover was not eaten, after the first eating of it in the Wildernesse, till they came into the Land of Canaan; for at the first eating thereof, they that came out of the Land of Aegypt were circumcised; and he saith, No uncircumcised person shall eate thereof.
<note place="margin">Exod. 12.48</note> And besides, he speaketh of Strangers joyning themselves to them, and eating thereof, which was done in the Land, for <hi>I</hi> read not of any Stranger joyning to them in the Wildernesse; or else, if it was eaten after the first time in the Wildernesse, then it is more cleare that Circumcision was neglected upon that speciall reason of their travailes, which they could not doe, and wait upon Gods removes; and therefore it was let alone upon a speciall reason, as it should seeme by speciall dispensation, till they came into the Land of Canaan. But we have a Law given by Christ to walke by, and need not walke by traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which is ground for us, to use those ordinances that have been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by Antichrist, though we have no new institution of speciall reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from Heaven, but the movings of the Spirit of God, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to our duty.</p>

               <p n="3">3 Consider, the scope of the Scripture is to shew that there is a day of perdition for ungodly m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But in these two Verses, 6, 7. consider;</p>
               <p n="1">1 The world that perished by water, was not former ordinances, but people, wicked men; yea the forme of Heaven and Earth was for the present quite marred, and nothing but ruine seen in neither.

               <p n="2">2 Consider, in the former destruction there was materiall water at the Flood; And therefore what reason can be shewed that here should not be meant also, materiall fire for the destruction of this?</p>
               <p>To that which some object that the earth shall continue after the generall day;</p>
               <p>I answer, 1 No Scripture saith so.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Suppose it doe, yet it hindreth not, but the earth and the things therein shall be burnt up <hi>(i. e.)</hi> destroyed by fire, as the former was destroyed, with the workes therein, by water; till it was anew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished.</p>
               <p n="3">3 If I should grant them that this is meant Ordinances; I thinke all that understand themselves, will confesse, we are not to lay them by, till God hath put a period to them. Now the time of their Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, you see here, is the day of judgement, and perdition of ungodly men: Therefore unlesse they can prove the day of Judgement, &amp;c. is now, it is not the time of ceasing of Ordinances, if that should be the meaning; but after that day we read of nothing afterwards, but the godly going into everlasting life, and the wicked into everlasting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and perdition, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 It is said, The Heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, &amp;c. Mark it, the ordinances are never called Heavens. But if any say, men have made them their Heavens, and thought they could not be saved without them. I answer, in that fence, Heaven may passe away, and Elements,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:165581:29"/>and Earth,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.9 Psal. 18.2</note> and all things; the Saints shall never rest upon them, to make them their foundation, nor trust, nor confidence, nor God. But this maketh no more for the CEASING of them, then because man hath made Gold his hope,
<note place="margin">Job 31.24</note> therefore he shall never use Gold more; The making it his hope shall cease, but he may use it still. So it is in this case.</p>
               <p>But for better understanding of this place, consider what in Scripture is called Heavens.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The Aire; therefore Fowles are called, Fowles of Heaven. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Spheares where the Starres are;
<note place="margin">Rev. 19.17 <hi>The severall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of heaven.</hi>
                  </note> therefore called, the Starres of Heaven. Sometimes the holy place where God is, the high and holy place, <hi>Psal.</hi> 26.6. And so it is a state of happinesse and glory, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. Sometimes for a state of dignity, a high state, <hi>Amos</hi> 9.2. <hi>Isa.</hi> 14.20. Sometimes for the Church of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.14. &amp; 12.1. Sometimes hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly spirituall things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. Sometimes God himselfe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.21 <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.26. I finde no other acception of Heaven in Scripture. Now there is no reason can be shewed that God himselfe, or Spirituall things, or the Church of God, or happinesse and glory, or the high and holy places where God is said to dwell shall be dissolved: Therefore it must needs meane either the Airie or Starry Heaven, or the high and lofty state of man, either within them, or without them, exalted against Christ; but what is this to Institutions and Ordinances of Christ?</p>
               <p>But some plead for the ceasing of Ordinances, and of the whole mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the primitive times, as well preaching, as Baptisme, and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, &amp;c. thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <q>Say they, The Apostles did fore-see, and fore-tell of a time of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy,

For therefore the man of sinne got into them, because God had accomplished his pleasure in those Administrations.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answer;
<note place="margin">That God had accomplished his work in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, and therefore the Apostles foretold of Apostasie, and falling away, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nswered.</note> I never read that the sinfulnesse of man, or his falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, put an end to any ordinance of God; but by God himselfe: for if so, then <hi>Judahs</hi> corrupting Gods ordinances so often as they did, under their Idolatrous Kings, should have put an end to those ordinances: But that is false, for they continued till Christ came, notwithstanding the corrupting of them by men, and falling away of <hi>Iudah</hi> so often, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of pure worship; therefore saith God, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.7. <hi>From the dayes of your fathers yee are gone AWAY from mine ordinances, and have not kept them; RETVRNE unto me saith the Lord &amp;c.</hi> And this was in Tythes and Offerings, and other ordinances wherein God saith, he was robbed: as the following Verses shew. So that you see, mans falling away from Gods ordinances, doth not put an end to them; for God calleth upon them to RETURNE.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That place in the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> doth not shew an end put to the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:165581:29"/>primitive Administrations; for then there must be an end put to preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and beleeving also; <hi>For faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the word preached;</hi> and that was a primitive Administration. And the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saith expresly, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Some shall depart from the faith:</hi> And Doctrine was corrupted by the man of Sinne, as well as other Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations. Yea, and <hi>Paul</hi> telleth <hi>Timothy, The time will come when men will not endure sound Doctrine,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 4.3. So that by this Argument, there is an end put to all sound Doctrine, preaching the Gospell, and faith; which is false: For the Gospell is to be preached to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture under heaven: And every creature lived not before the falling away. So that you see this is deceitfull arguing.</p>
               <p>The first Reason he sheweth, <q>That God had done his pleasure in that first Ministration, and so it was ceased; is, because if not so, then there is a power able to crosse the power of God which is Atheisticall to imagine.</q>

It is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.29. After that tribulation there spoken of, the Stars shall fall from Heaven; If by Heaven there be meant the Church, and by Stars the Ministers or Angels, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. Then it will follow by this arguing, that there is now no ministration, no Stars or Angels to minister in the Churches. And if Gods owne people be the Angels, as Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> saith; And the Angels be Stars, as Christ saith; Then their falling away putteth not an end to their ministration, though it cloud it for a while.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Consider, that in those times of Antichrist, and the prevailing of the man of Sin, all did not fall away, as I have proved before: But God had his remnant still, that stuck to him, and worshipped not the Beast, nor wandered not after him; And therefore that ministration was not terminated at that time: For, because some fell away, it will not prove that the Ministration is ended, and Gods pleasure done in it,
<note place="margin">Mat 13.</note> no more then because the Stony-ground-hearers fell away, it putteth an end to the preaching of the Gospell, and hearing the Word. Nor because some shall depart from the Faith. Therefore it is put to an end; and God hath done his pleasure in the ministery of Faith. And because many follow the pernicious wayes of false Teachers, therefore it put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth an end to the way of truth.</p>

Now who shall take God out of the way, if it mean him, and his power? It should rather have been, till he remove himselfe out of the way: But this word TAKEN sheweth some other Let, that God had appointed to hinder for a time.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In this revealing of the wicked one, or man of Sinne, God put not an end to his Administrations; but made way for execution of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon the wicked, that they might be brought to destruction, and just recompence for their wickednesse, as appeareth, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2 10, 11, 12. <hi>He shall come with all deceiveablenesse of unrighteousnesse in them that perish, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they received not the love of the truth, &amp;c. that they all might be damned, who beseeved not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousnesse.</hi> And mark it, here is the cause of his appearing (I mean Antichrist) <hi>And for this cause God shall send them strong delusions, that they should beleeve a lye.</hi> Not to put an end to the ministrations of the primitive times, but as a just punishment of hypocriticall, and false-hearted Professours: Therefore he exhorteth the Thessalonians, and in them all other beleevers, and Churches of Christ to stand fast, and hold the Traditions or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances that they have been taught, either by word, or the Apostles E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles; And prayeth that God may stablish them in every good word and work, <hi>ver.</hi> 15.17.

               <p>For 1 <hi>Paul</hi> charged <hi>Timothy, That the things he had heard of him,

But all this is untrue, therefore the other is as untrue and groundlesse from that Scripture, or any other Scripture. But if he meane in outward gifts or Miracles, I confesse God had done his worke in them, for confirming the word then spoken: so the Man of Sinne prevailed against them, and they ceased for the present. But for other things, the Scripture hath not so much as a shadow of proofe. <hi>Paul</hi> must fulfill his Ministery, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Timothy</hi> must fulfill his Ministery, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Tychicus</hi> must fulfill his Ministery, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.17.

                  <q>So that (saith he) Gods with-drawing his irresistable power from that Ministery, and so gave way to the an of Sinne, was a cleare testimony that God had done his worke in it? and now the man of sinne must beare sway in usurping, and corrupting that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, &amp;c.</q>

               <p n="2">2 The Man of Sinne prevailing for a time, is no more testimony that that Ministery is ceased, then because the Babilonians prevailed against the Jewes, and Jerusalem, and destroyed it for a time, and burnt the House of the Lord, that therefore that Ministery was cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; which notwithstanding did not cease, though Israel were Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for a time, but was restored againe so soone as they were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: yea, and as much of that Ministery as God had not tyed strictly to Jerusalem, they acted in Babilon: They Circumcised in Babilon,

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>a</hi> Mat. 18.</note> Therefore there they may carry on ordinances.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <q>He saith, it appeareth further, that ordinances were to cease, by the bringing in of a more excellent and glorious Ministery; which was Christ comming in the glory of his God-head, spoken of in <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. and seene by <hi>John</hi> in a Vision, as of a time to come; and therefore <hi>John</hi> was taken up into a higher condition, when he saw that Ministery on foot, which doth intimate to us, that the Saints shall be enabled in the dayes of that Ministery, not in their owne vaine glory, but in the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:165581:31"/>clearer knowledge of the glory of Christ. Hence it was that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle doth plead for a further growth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answer; This Argument, with the proofes,
<note place="margin">That ordinances are ceased by bringing in of a more glorious Ministery, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</note> make but an empty sound without substance. There is not a word spoken in <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. of the ceasing of any Ministery, except the ministery of the Whore, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; the rest of the Chapter treateth of the Marriage of the Lamb, and the trimming of his Wife, and his conquering of his enemies: But not a word of any ministery ceasing. And all this was in its measure then, in the Apostles dayes; He might have done well to have shewed the verse, or words, for the ground of his Argument. That that ministration was then on foot is cleare; the Apostle saith,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.16</note>
                  <hi>They know Christ no more after the flesh;</hi> Then it seemeth was the ministery of his God-head, and that is alwaies glorious; for God and glory cannot be seperated:
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.14</note> Therefore those that see him are said to be changed into the same Image from glory to glory. And they that beleeve in him, are said to rejoyce with glorious joy; yea, and the glory of the God-head of Christ did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare very glorious in the dayes of his Flesh, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. The ministery of his God-head was seene in his people then, so it is now:
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. ult. 1 Pet. 1.8</note> And he was married then, to those he tooke into Covenant; and then opposed, and tooke vengeance upon his enemies (though there be severall seasons in which he doth things more fully, and clearly then at some other times) so that the same Ministery was afoot in its measure in <hi>Iohns</hi> time; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are said to be changed into the same Image from glory to glory. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>To that, that the Apostle pleadeth for further growth; That he doth in many places: But what is this to the ceasing of an outward ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? when <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>Iob</hi> 17.9. <hi>He that hath cleane hands shall grow stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and stronger;</hi> doth he meane, that the former strength shall cease, and a new strength possesse that man? Or doth he meane, there shall still be an addition of strength to that which he had? He doth not meane, the former strength must be laid by, and another strength taken; but more added:
<note place="margin">Iob 1.5</note> neither doth he meane that his sacrificing should cease because he groweth stronger and stronger. When a Childe groweth towards mans stature, and strength, he doth not first lese that small stature or strength, which he had; but findeth an addition of more to that which he had. So when <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth the Thessalonians to abound in love more,
<note place="margin">1 Thess. 4.10</note> he doth not meane he should lay by love in that measure or kinde they had it; but adde more to it. So that this will not prove the laying by a ministration, but an addition of more glorious discoveries of God, to that which the Saints have formerly.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>He saith, I may see the truth of this in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. compared with <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13, 14. In which places the Apostle doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the shortnesse of the ministery then present, to what should be; and telleth us that, that ministery was but in part, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect; but he looked for one to come, that should be perfect, &amp;c
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:165581:32"/>And then by the appearing of that, the other should bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, The Scriptures cited, prove no such thing as they are cited for. For the thing to be proved is, That the Apostles Ministery, or that in the primitive times, in regard of Bapisme with water, the Supper, Preaching, &amp;c. are extinguished, or ceased by the bringing in of a Better Ministery; which Ministery is now, as the Authour of this plea intimateth; for else why doth he plead they ARE ceased?

And page 278. he saith, Ordinances is the Glasse. Page 294. he saith, The Administrations and gifts in the primitive times, was but a Ministery in part, and darkly as in a glasse. And page 297 All that pure administration of Ordinances and Gifts, wherein God is seen, as in a glasse.</q> Page 264. He calleth graces and gifts a Glasse.

               <p>I answer, Christ was come in Spirit to <hi>Paul;</hi> for God had revealed his Sonne in him, and to the Corinthians also, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 101. Then they should not have seene God through Faith, Love, Humility, Selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniall, &amp;c. But that is not so, therefore that is not the meaning; for so Christ was come to <hi>Abraham, Moses,</hi> and all beleevers of old, so that they should not then have used any Ordinance.</p>
               <p>To that place of <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13.14. I say,
<note place="margin">Another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the primitive mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations are ceased, is from our experience, we have not had their Doctrine taught for many hundred yeares &amp;c. answered.</note> The Apostle speaketh not one word nor syllable, of any Ordinance under the Gospell, as if those should be the things he did forget, which are behinde; but of his legall priviledges, duties, zeale, blamelesse walkings, &amp;c. whereby hee thought to be justified, and made them his gaine, as appeareth in the former part of the Chapter. Other Scriptures are cited, and many more words added to this; but they are such empty things, that I will spend no more paper, and time upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Another argument to prove the primitive ministrations ceased, in respect of externall practice (meaning Baptisme, the Supper, Preaching, Reading, Hearing, Conference, &amp;c. for all these are externall practices, and more too) is, <q>By our owne experience finding of it so, which is a

                  <q>Then for Baptisine, instead of Beleevers being baptised, they have set up a whorish Baptisme of Infants; And then for the end of it too, Christ appointed Baptisme to manifest beleevers; and it is used to make Beleevers.</q> And what is this to prove Baptisme ceased, because a false Subject, and a false end, have been thrust upon it by some or most, when it is administred upon a true Subject, and to a true end againe?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And for the Lords Supper, It was appointed for communion of Saints in his death; and it is a communion for all the Lyars, Whores, Swearers, and all the filthy rabble of the earth; and so hath beene this many hundred yeares.</q> But doth this make the use of it cease, without some speciall appointment of God, and now have the Saints no communion in such an Ordinance, because it hath been abused? where doth the Lord say, If a Lyar, a Whore, &amp;c. partake of this Ordinance then it ceaseth, and the Saints are never to use it again? If God say not so, why will man say so? Must the children never taste bread more, because the servant that should have given them their portion in due season,
<note place="margin">Mat. 24.48, 49, 50.</note> hath eaten and drunken with the drunken, and smitten them a while? I see no such rule, That when the purity of an Ordinance is corrupted, the Ordinance ceaseth; Did not Israell lose the purity of her Ordinances when she had corrupted them, and changed Gods
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:165581:33"/>Judgements more then the Nations, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5. And yet they ceased not because of this, till Christ put an end to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 He pleadeth, <q>The primitive ministery is ceased, because we have lost the power of them, and the glory that was in them, together with the offices, qualifications of the persons and ministers thereof; as first, they were endued with power from on high, commanding and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorising them. 2 There was a glorious power and spirit alwaies go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before them, leading them into the infallibility of truth. 3 A mighty and miraculous power testifying that they were in the truth, to the conviction of others. And then for qualifications, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in their Judgements; they had a spirit of discerning, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne truth from error; they were filled with such wisdome and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, as that they were able to confound all that ever opposed them. And then for offices, they had Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, all which are ceased. So that we have neither the same power, nor the same qualifications, nor the same offices, nor the true and exact in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible form of it.</q> Then what ground is there for us to revive those things? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I answer; That the Church is to have the same offices,
<note place="margin">An Argument that they are ceased, because we have not the power, nor glory of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, neither in qualifications, nor officers, nor in the true exact infallible form, answered.</note> qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ministery of that first Age, in all respects and particulars, I see no ground nor need; they were then to lay the foundation, and none other foundation can be laid, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. we are to build upon it. But there were offices, qualifications, and ministers in the first times, which are to continue till the comming of Christ to judge quicke and dead; as appeareth in the first Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and those we are to have still, as I have proved before; and those qualifications men may have, and such a ministery: And that is it that we stand for, not for that which was to cease, but for that which is to remaine.</p>
               <p>And to answer to the particulars;</p>
               <p n="1">1 We are indued with the same power Authorising us, as they had then; for Christ was he that did authorise them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. because all power was given him in heaven, and in earth; therefore he biddeth them goe preach, &amp;c. And the same Christ authoriseth us; for that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand did not concerne the Apostles only, but <hi>Philip,</hi> and other Disciples that preached, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. and baptised by that Commission, as well as the Apostles; and the same Commission reacheth to Disciples still, as I proved: we have the word of Christ for our authority, as they had then.</p>
               <p n="2">2 For the Spirits going before them to leade them into the infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of truth; I answer, Others administred, that did what they did from study, and Scriptures, and the teaching of the Apostles; as well as of the infallible Spirit; as I have proved before of <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 76.</note> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: so doe we now. Besides, we are to speake no new Scripture, nor erect new ordinances; and therefore need not that infallible spirit which they had. Beside, though we have not that infallible Spirit, or rather
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:165581:34"/>not that measure, as we confesse; yet it is like these men have it, for they say, That which is perfect is come. And if they be not infallible, then they are not perfect, for that which erreth is not perfect But if they be infallible, then they may administer ordinances, as they did in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times: And so they doe ill to neglect their duty.</p>
               <p n="3">3 To the miraculous power testifying, &amp;c. I answer, it was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme their word, as I have shewed before; when we are called to speak and write another Scripture, then that power will be usefull; but not till then: In the meane time, those things were written that we might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, <hi>John</hi> 20. <hi>ult.</hi> And the Spirit is given to convince the world now, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8. and not miracles.</p>
               <p>To the second, for their qualifications, 1. The infallibility of their Judgements: I answer, I finde no such qualifications either of Bishops or Deacons, which are officers to continue in the Churches, that they must be of infallible judgements, either in <hi>Timothy,</hi> or <hi>Titus.</hi> 2. They dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned truth from errors then, so farre as was needfull for their worke, of writing new Scriptures, and preaching Christ, and planting Churches, &amp;c. And so doe the Saints now; so farre as to preach Christ, gather the Saints into order, &amp;c. according to the worke God calleth us to now; as they did according to the worke he called them to then: for we have the promise of the Spirit, to lead into truth, as well as they had. And either these men are in an error, as well as we; if they be in the truth, and discerne it from error, then why doe they not administer ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as the primitive Administrators did? Or if they erre, in denying ordinances of Baptisme, Supper, Preaching, Praying, Reading, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Scriptures, &amp;c. Then let them give us leave (as seeing the truth) to administer ordinances commanded in the Scriptures of the New Testament.</p>
               <p>To the third concerning offices of Apostles,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 79, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> &amp;c. I have sufficiently answered before. And therefore I conclude, we have ground to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive this practise, which God yet never laid downe, but only was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by men.</p>
               <p>Againe, some plead the ceasing of them, by paralelling them with the ordinances of the Law; and paralelling the cause of the ceasing of the one, to be the cause of the ceasing of the other; as, 1. <q>Those of the Law ceased, 1. By the appearing of the substantiall Sacrifice Jesus Christ, held forth in them, <hi>Col</hi> 2.16, 17. 2. By bringing in a farre better, and more glorious Ministery, under which the Church was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and planted, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9, 10. 3. By Gods with-drawing of his presence from it, whose presence was the life and beauty of it. Now let us parallel these, with the Apostles ministery. 1. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did not hold out their Ministery for eternity, but untill the Lord did come, so that they also expected the comming of Christ. And how? why in a more glorious ministery and manner; and their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration was limited to that time, as the other was limited to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:165581:34"/>Christs comming in the flesh: So in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26, 27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. So that when Christ commeth in a more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner, and ministery, then this hath done its worke, as the other had.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answer; 1.
<note place="margin">An Argument for ceasing of ordinances by paralelling them with the lawes, ordinances, and the cause of the ceasing of the one, the cause of the ceasing of the other, examined.</note> He might have done well to have shewed us what that glorious ministery was, as the Prophets did of old shew how that mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery pointed at the Messia's comming in the flesh, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. <hi>To us a childe is borne, to us a Son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name, &amp;c.</hi> And Chap. 7. <hi>A virgin shall be with childe, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah</hi> prophesied of his being borne in Bethlehem, &amp;c.

                     </gap>
                  </hi> by the Angel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. Tell us by as plaine infallible proofes when this comming is in a more glorious ministery; till then, you leave us in the darke. But let us examine the Scriptures he citeth.</p>
               <p>The first is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26, 27. Here he speaketh only of the ministery of the Supper; not of Baptisme, nor preaching, nor any other part of their ministery: And this COMMING I have proved before, to be his comming at the last day in Person, as he Ascended; as is fore-told by the Angel, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.11. And when he so commeth, we will wait upon him alone for further direction; in the meane time, we desire to walke according to the rule of Scripture. 2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10. I have fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered before also, proving that, not to be while the Saints live in this life. To that of <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. I answer; This Scripture maketh nothing for the ceasing of the Aposiles ministery by a more glorious mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, for it speaketh nothing of the Apostles ministery, but of the Prophets ministery that lived before Christs comming in the flesh. For 1. He compareth it to a Candle shining in a darke place; so was the word then called, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.114. <hi>Thy word is a light—and a Lantherne &amp;c.</hi> And the darke place was under those darke types, and shadowes of the Law. 2. He speaketh, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. of Prophesies of Scriptures which were the old Prophesies, which were then in writing; the Prophesies of the New Testament were not now (or at least all of them) written; as that of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Or if he meane not so, yet he intimateth to them, that what they spake may be compared with, and proved by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies of old time: But it is most cleare, he speaketh of the former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies among themselves, one interpreting another, and all by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. 3. He confirmeth it, ver. 21. where he telleth them, <hi>The Prophesie came not in OLD time, by the will of man, &amp;c.</hi> 4. In the 2 chap. ver. 1. he telleth them, There were false Prophets among the people, even as there shall be false Teachers among you; which sheweth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he spake of former Prophesies, that spake of Christ to come; and if they were well searched into, they might see, they held out the same Christ to them as the Apostles did; and this he saith, they did well to take heed to, till they had clearer testimony upon their owne spirit, then they had for the present, for they were yet but weake; and therefore he
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:165581:35"/>exhorteth them to adde to their faith vertue, and to vertue knowledge, &amp;c.
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.5.</note> So that this proveth nothing at all, that when Christ commeth in a more glorious Ministration, then the Apostles ministration was to cease.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <q>It is done away in the same sense, by the bringing in a more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ministery, even the ministery of the Revelation; for that must have its time, as well as other ministrations: And hence it was that all the world was so blinded in that ministery, that scarce a man could tell a word in it, because it was sealed for 1360. dayes, untill the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> did come to open it. And it is cleare that the time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>opening and revealing of that ministery is come, for the Saints can many of them run and read the mystery of God in it. Now the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles ministery was to hold out the Mystery of Christs Man-hood in the fulnesse of it; this ministery of the <hi>Revelation</hi> is to hold out the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the God-head; the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, <hi>Revel</hi> 19. Now the Apostles ministery was to hold out Christs Man-hood in the fulnesse of it, and to last till that was done, and no longer: And this will appeare not only by the Apostles common expressions in all their ministery, but also more fully in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.9, 10, 11, 12, 13. where the Apostle saith, That Christ had given gifts and offices to the Church, of Apostles, Prophets, and Evangelists, untill they all come; that is, All the Saints of that age did come to the perfect knowledge and unity of Christ, a perfect man. Now it cannot relate to any suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Age of the Church, because we know that these offices and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers have lasted no longer then the present state of the primitive Church: And Christ appointed them to remaine till all the Saints, that is of that time, did come to that knowledge; therefore that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery was limited to Christs Man-hood; and this in the <hi>Revelation</hi> to bring forth the fulnesse of Christs glory and God-head.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this I answer;
<note place="margin">That ordinances are ceased by bringing in a more glorious ministration, the ministration of the Revelation, answered.</note> The objection being the same with the former, as he saith, The former answer might serve. But to follow it a little, I desire his proofe that the <hi>Revelation</hi> was sealed for, 1360. dayes, I know no Scripture saith so, And then Christ openeth it; but this I finde, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.16. <hi>John</hi> is forbidden to seale the sayings of the Prophesie of that Booke, because the time was at hand. Now whether we shall beleeve the Scripture, or mans speech against it, I leave it to every one to judge. And for that little Book, the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> opened, doth clearly appeare by <hi>Revel.</hi> 5. was the event that fell out both in the Church, and world in after Generations, which was revealed to <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And because it was sealed (saith he) all the world was so blinde in that ministery, &amp;c.</q> I answer, It is true; So the WORLD is still; but the Saints have run as fast in it before, as now; witnesse <hi>Mr. Brightman,</hi> and others that have spoken rarely upon it; And many men speaking their fancies upon it, without comparing it with other
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:165581:35"/>Scriptures, doe not shew the time of that ministery is come. Beside, if it be come, that followeth not that the Apostles ministery is abolished by it; for there was preaching the Gospell: So is the Ministery of this booke, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.6.</p>
               <p>To the distinction of the mystery of Christs Man-hood, and God-head, that the one was revealed by the Apostles in their time, till the falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the other revealed now of late; I finde no ground for such a distinction of Man-hood and God-head, to be revealed distinctly in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ages: But the Mystery of Christ, is the Mystery of Man-hood and God-head both; and this was revealed by the Apostles ministery, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2. The Apostle had a conflict for the Colosians, that they might know the mystery of God, and the Father, and of Christ; and he was not Christ as he was God alone, or man alone, but God-man: And <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. saith, <hi>Great is the mystery of godlinesse, God was manifest in the flesh, justified in spirit, seene of Angels, &amp;c. and received up into glory:</hi> Is here no revealing of the mystery of his GOD-HEAD? was God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seene of Angels, preached to the Gentiles, beleeved on in the world, and received up into glory, as he was man alone, or as he was God and man? The Apostle saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. The righteousnesse of God is revealed in the Gospell that he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; this was something of the mystery of the God-head sure. And so, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.3-11. wherein you may see that what <hi>Paul</hi> had received of the Lord concerning the mystery of Christ by Revelation, he wrote to the Ephesians that they might understand it; and it was about calling of Soules to God, and revealing the unsearchable riches of Christ, to the admiration of principalities and powers in heavenly places: Was here nothing of the my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ery of the God-head? Yea, saith he, It was hid in GOD, from the Ages past, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. Did they reveale nothing but how he was made flesh, and dwelt in the world, and suffered, &amp;c. which was the mystery of his Man hood? Did they speake nothing of his Spirit, and Scepter, and Glory? The Scripture throughout speaketh otherwise, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. Him hath God exalted to be a PRINCE, and a Saviour, to give Repentance, and remission; Is this nothing of his God-head? As he was man, he was not Ruler, nor Judge, nor gave Repentance, but as God. And in the beginning of most of their Epistles they make him one with the Father, as the fountaine of Grace, mercy, and peace to the Saints; and is not this of the mystery of the God-head?</p>
               <p>But he seemeth to intimate the mystery of the God-head to be this, that he is Lord of Lords; and King of Kings, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. And was not this revealed in the Apostles ministery till now of late? Doth not <hi>Peter</hi> say, <hi>Act,</hi> 2 God hath made him both LORD and CHRIST. And <hi>Act.</hi> 10 He is LORD of all. And <hi>Iames,</hi> chap. 2. calleth him, THE LORD of glory. And <hi>Paul</hi> revealeth him to be LORD of LORDS, and KING of KINGS, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.15.</p>
               <p>Againe, the mystery of Christs man-hood is taught in the Revelation,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:165581:36"/>as well as his God-head; for marke the first words, It is called, <hi>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which GOD gave him.</hi> Now God gave him the Revelation not as he was God, but according to the man-hood; for according to the God-head he gave it. And saith <hi>John, I saw one like the Son of man;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> saw him as a Lamb slaine, as well as upon the white Horse LORD of LORDS, and King of Kings. And hee himselfe revealeth the mystery of his man-hood; for faith he, <hi>I was DEAD, and am alive, &amp;c.</hi> Revel. 1.18. Therefore this is a groundlesse distinction.</p>
               <p>He saith, <q>That the Apostles Ministery was to hold out the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of Christs man hood, &amp;c. appeared fully in <hi>Ephes</hi> 4.9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Scripture is not so read as he readeth it; <hi>But till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulnesse of Christ (i.e.)</hi> not the knowledge of Christs man-hood, or the mystery of it, but so to the knowledge of him God and man, and the enjoyment of him by faith, that we are perfected in him, as the 12 <hi>ver.</hi> sheweth, The end of that Ministery is to perfect the Saints, that so we may bee established, and not moved, and carried every way with every wind of Doctrine, as the verse following: And whether this perfection be in this life or no, it is a great question.</p>
               <p>To that, that he saith it cannot re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, Then they are in a poore case, for they have no benefit of Christs Ascention, for these gifts were given by vertue thereof: Neither can they looke to be edified, or perfected, or setled, or stablished; for that was the end of these gifts. But his ground is, because these Offices and Officers lasted no longer. I answer, we know no such matter; neither doth he prove it;
<note place="margin">Page 86.</note> And I have proved the contrary before, we have them in their works, and writings, and some of them in their persons: Neither can he prove, that Apostles, Prophets, and Evangelists lasted in the Church in person (any otherwise then I have formerly proved) till the falling away prophesied of in the Thessalonians, which he saith put an end to their Ministery; and if not, how then were they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected after the Apostles times till then? Beside, the Revelation speaketh of holy Apostles and Prophets to rejoyce at the down-fall of the Whore;
<note place="margin">Rev. 18.20.</note> Therefore that Ministery, and offices and officers, did not end in that Age</p>
               <p n="3">3 He saith,

               <p>Againe, The with drawings of God from his Ordinances in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious presence, doth not certainly conclude the cessarion of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances without restoring them againe. God with-drew from the Temple, and that worship when Israel had corrupted it; as appeareth, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.3. <hi>The GLORY of God went up from the Cherubims, to the threshold of the house, and that in anger, calling for ruine upon the people, and the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary;</hi> as appeareth by the <hi>verse, from thence he removeth to the East-gate of the Lords house, Ezek.</hi> 10.19.

                     </note> false Prophet, and Devill, is not a time of restitution, and restauration of the first ministery of Gifts or Ordinances, as was in the Apostles times; but of the state and persecution of the Lord Jesus in Spirit, and the time of the Womans being in the wildernesse; All things in this time seeming a waste and barren dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation about her, not inhabited by the Spirit of God, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, All this time of her being in the wildernesse, there was a Temple, and Altar, and worshippers therein So then there was Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, for the Temple and Altar were not without Ordinances, though more retired, and private then formerly, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.1.

               <p>He saith page 111. <q>The Spirit of God foreseeing God about to leave this ministration of Gospel glory to the world (he meaneth Gifts and Ordinances) and bring a night upon all that day of his Son, prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of the time to come, and to succeed that glory, &amp;c. and citeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Scriptures, as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4, 5. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>Jude</hi> 17. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.18 So that he saith, from these Scriptures we see the Apostles prophesied of a Spirit of iniquity to reigne among the Saints.</q>

               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:165581:37"/>
               <p> I answer, This was but in those that were hypocrites, and hollow, and not the sincere hearted: And this was but in some men, not in all the Saints: Neither will it follow, that the Saints laid by the practice of the truth, because these fell backe, <hi>Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. speaketh of such as denyed the power of godlinesse, and onely had a forme; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth them to <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> and calleth them evill men and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers in the Chapter; Therefore they never were Saints.

So <hi>Jude</hi> speaketh of mockers, separating themselves from the Saints (not Saints, nor all that professe Religion (mockers, and separating themselves.) So that there was Churches still.

               <p>Page 116. he saith, <q>There is not one word appearing in all the Scripture, that that first Ministery of Gists and Ordinances shall in any measure be continued, though in part, or in reservation to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored; as if that were the great worke the Lord intended to bring to passe, <hi>viz.</hi> A setting up a pure Ministery of gifts to teach his people, or restoring some legall Ordinances, as Baptisme with water the Church way, or Presbytery of Elders, &amp;c. And all the glory of the last times and age, should be the bringing in these and taking them out of the hands of Antichrist: All which ariseth from a mistake of the type of the Jewish Apostasie and Captivity, which figured out the Spirituall Church, or New Jerusalem in Babylon, or Captivity to the flesh, or man of sinne, in all his dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>I answer, There is warrant in Scripture,
<note place="margin">The Objection That there is no warrant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store Ordinances, answered, and the contrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> for men to returne to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances that they have forsaken; Christ having not put an end to them, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. <hi>Ye are gone away from mine Ordinances</hi> (saith God) <hi>returne to me.</hi> So that falling away putteth not an end to Ordinances; but when men have fallen from them, God hath called upon them to returne to him: so that they may take them up againe, and re-assume them.</p>

If a vice or sin, then to rise again must needs be a duty, and necessary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But Christs appearing is, when he commeth more fully in spirit.</p>
               <p>I Answer, Christ was then come in Spirit within them, and did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; that was, they had sweet enjoyments and full enjoyments of Christ and spake from sweet experiences, as <hi>Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. the latter end: And were so gifted by the spirit, that they could speak immediately from the same; and therefore it meaneth his comming, and appearing at the last day, and so it is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. and <hi>Mat,</hi> 28. <hi>ult.</hi> The end of the world is then.</p>
               <p>But he saith, This Commandement <hi>(i.e.)</hi> that in the 12 Verse.</p>
               <p>I Answer, How will that be proved, which of them, in the 12 ver. or the 11 ver? For if it be singled out, a man must tell us which, and prove it, that it respecteth that and no other. But I conceive it meaneth all the Epistle, concerning Doctrine, Worship, Order, and Officers. And therefore Ordinances may be taken up from Antichrist. And we have warrant in Scripture, to bring things to the first Institution, as I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before, and to Repent, and do our first works, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5. therefore to restore Ordinances. And Mr, <hi>Salim.</hi> saith p. 107. The Administration of gifts, and Ordinances was a pure glory, and will not God have pure glory restored?</p>
               <p n="4">4 God calleth his people out of Babylon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. <q>And the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of iniquity (saith he) worketh as well without unto the world, as within, in the flesh of every Saint, pa. 114.</q> Then by his own confession there is an outward comming out of Babilon, (as well as an inward) and not being a partaker of her sins. And her sins are false worships, and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and constitution of Churches, as well as inward corruptions. So he saith pa. 217. <q>That Antichrist from within, sheweth himself to the world in all idolatrous forms, in false interpretations of God, and of the Truth, as it is in Jesus.</q> Therefore he calleth them to the forsaking of what was corrupted, and the restoring of the Truth, so far as it was in their power to restore it. For extraordinary gifts it was not in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they were given upon some speciall reason; therefore not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. But there is no such speciall reason for Ordinances. And this hath been a Scripture way, to call things to the first institution, when they have been corrupted, So Christ doth by marriage, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it was not so, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.8. and <hi>Malachi,</hi> He made one, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> one man for one woman, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15. And <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Corinthians</hi> concerning the Supper; And God himself saith <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.26. <hi>I will restore thy Judges, as at the FIRST, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:165581:38"/>
               <p> And if there be no restoring of Ordinances, I wonder why he preached, or instructed; that is an Ordinance, and accompanied men that had gifts, and that was corrupted by Antichrist also. And when the people of God are come out of Babylon in outward things, shall the outward man doe nothing? How shall God bee glorified with our bodies then?</p>
               <p>All along his booke he putteth Gifts and Ordinances together, and maketh the ceasing of the one, to be the ceasing of the other.
<note place="margin">A distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Gifts and Ordinances.</note> To which I say, That is not so; The one was for confirmation of the word, but not the other; but for the Saints to walk in, and which they were to keep till the appearing of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Page 118. He saith, That Revelation (there mentioned) is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Christ in Spirit, He and his Father being the light and temple of his people, for there shall be no other there: This shall be a glory without Sun, or Moon, or Stars, or any such low and faint appearances, as gifts and Ordinances, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Then I hope, he will allow us a Temple, till that time come, for <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.1. There was a Temple. And he saith, that Ordinances are ceased now; and yet he expoundeth the Temple to be formes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, page. 211.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If there shall be no light but the Father and Christ in his sense, then not of Mr. <hi>Saltmarshes,</hi> or any other mans preachings, or bearing witnesse to God; for that is but low and faint: why do they not lay downe their preaching with other Ordinances.</p>
               <p n="5">5 It is said, <hi>John Baptist</hi> came in the Spirit and power of <hi>Elias,</hi> to turne the heart of the fathers to the children, &amp;c. And he is said to RESTORE all things, as <hi>Eliah</hi> did the worship of God of old, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.12. And the Scripture saith, <hi>He that is least in the Kingdome of heaven is greater then he;</hi> which cannot be, if he hath not power to restore lost, or corrupted Ordinances, as <hi>John</hi> had.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The two witnesses, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. are set out by allusion to men that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored Religion in their times; As <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did restore Religion to Israel when they had brought them out of Egypt. <hi>Elijah,</hi> and <hi>Elisha,</hi> that restored Religion from <hi>Baals</hi> Idolatry. <hi>Jehoshua</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> that restored Religion after Babylons Captivity. Therefore the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses are such as restore it so far as they can, from Antichrist that hath polluted it.</p>
               <p n="7">7 When things have been corrupted, the word of God, the Scripture hath been sufficient for the restoring of Ordinances; for so <hi>Hezekiah</hi> restored worships according to the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron,</hi> 29.25, with 28, 24. and 29.6, 7. And so the building of the Temple after the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, was according to the Law of God, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.25. and 5.1. And the dwelling in Booths, as soon as they found it in the Law, they did not wait for an extraordinary Prophet, or new Institution (though it had been neglected many Generations, even from <hi>Joshuahs</hi> time:) But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently

               <p>To that which he saith, is a mistake, <q>The taking of Ordinances out of the hands of Antichrist, from the Jewish Apostasie.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, No mistake at all; For if Antichrist be in outward things to the world, as well as in inward (as he saith) Then so farre as the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spreading hath beene in outward things, so farre their restoring is alike.</p>
               <p>Page 49. he saith, <q>The Ministery that shall destroy Antichrist shall be more powerfull and mighty then the Ministery of gifts: And this (he saith) shall be the Lord Jesus Christ, that Prophet whom we are to heare, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. and the God of whom we shall all be taught; Ye shall all be taught of God, &amp;c.

It was but by word sure; Beside, I thinke he was not anointed with that pure anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that infallible Spirit as the Apostles were; And let him shew one that is called Preacher of the Gospell, that was not so gifted: And unlesse he were so gifted, I wonder he would assume that Title, and be so against it. That he was not so gifted, I shall make appeare after, by his contradictions to himselfe, and others; and mistakings of Scriptures, &amp;c. And he that wrote (The Doctrine of Baptismes) is against him; for he saith, The word preached is the Gospell, Page 19.</p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:165581:40"/>
               <p> Againe, he mistaketh in his definition here; For it is the mystery of Salvation declared in word to man. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15. <hi>Go preach the GOSPEL &amp;c.</hi> And he himself saith, No man could disciple men; Then they could not reveale the Gospel to the spirits of men, or in spirit to men: But Christ sent out his Disciples to preach the Gospel, and he did not mock them when he sent them out. And <hi>Paul</hi> saith <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.16. that he mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed the Gospel. But he could not do it to the Spirit. And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.18. that I might make the Gospel without charge; meaning the preaching of the same, by word of mouth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.2. he saith, he communicated unto them the Gospel. Yea, and these very wayes that the Apostles preached, and practised, they called the Gospel, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.15. The Gospel was from the beginning, but the beginning of this way of administration, or disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, is that which he calleth the Gospel. So saith he again, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.5. our Gospel came not to you in word only, &amp;c. but he saith not, not in word at all. And saith 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.4. They were put in trust with the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Yea, the maintainance for the Minister, is called the Gospel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9 14. There is abundance of places in the New Testament, speak of preaching the Gospel: And what was that? why, that which Christ sent them out to preach. What was that? Repentance, and Remission of sins through his name, <hi>buk.</hi> 24.47. Peace by Jesus Christ. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.36. Teaching obedience to all things, he commanded his Disciples in that time, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. ult. This is the Gospel the Scripture manifesteth. The Scripture calleth the Inward work rather the blessing of the Gospel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.29. Or the mystery of the Gospel, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.19. So that this distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of cloathing of the Gospel, will not be made good from Scripture: It is called the Gospel, though it be not so properly the blessing of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, till it be brought to the heart.</p>
               <p>Yea, here he maketh the Scripture but part of the cloathing, Parables, Figures, &amp;c. Whereas indeed, part of the Scriptures are Parables, but not all; as he would have us understand, and citeth <hi>John</hi> 16.24. to prove it; but it doth not prove it. He readeth it, Hitherto have I spoken to you in Proverbs: But the word is, These things have I spoken, &amp;c. meaning, some things that he spake immediately before. For when he expounded the Parable of the Sower, was that Exposition a Parable? He spake to the people in Parables, to his Disciples alone, plainly; and that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse presently after, <hi>John</hi> 16.29.</p>
               <p>Pag, 271. He saith upon his distinction, which is not proved by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (and Philosophy or Reason may deceive) <q>That the distinction used concerning Ordinances, when they are called Gospel Ordinances, Gospel Commandements, in contra-distinction to the legall Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is a great mistake, &amp;c. for all the Ordinances under the Law, were Gospel Ordinances, or Ordinances holding forth a Christ; And so the Ordinances of the New Testament; and are all alike literall, outward, and visible, &amp;c. And would prove them the same, from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 4. <hi>They did all eat the same spirituall meat, &amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I answer: This Scripture is utterly mistaken, for this rising up to play, is not to be attributed to such refreshments by ordinances here spoken of; but after their Idolatrous feast, as you may see, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.6. it was not their being refreshed with water and Manna, nor any of Gods administrations: But with their Golden Idol Calfe.

               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi>
                  <q>But where is the baptisme of gifts there mentioned?</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answer: There is the baptisme of the Spirit, and that is both gifts and fruits: for else we are not baptised by one Spirit into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 13. for we all have not those gifts. And so saith he that wrote the Doctrine of Baptismes, <hi>pag.</hi> 9. &amp; 22. <q>The Baptisme of the Spirit, is Gods dwelling in us by the worke of the Spirit. And Master <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 39. that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 12 is being baptised into his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Body.</q> It is a great Question, whether the baptisme of the Spirit be the baptisme of gifts only, and not the inward worke of the Spirit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so? for had <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his company only gifts when the Holy Ghost fell upon them? I conceive their hearts were wrought upon also: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though the Baptism of the Spirit did consist partly in gifts, yet not wholly. And so we have the Baptisme of the Spirit still, though not in the same outward,
<note place="margin">What the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is.</note> extraordinary gifts as they had. And Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> maketh them but one; for <hi>pag.</hi> 34. he saith, <q>
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. <hi>Goe teach all Nations, baptising them into the name, &amp;c.</hi> is the baptisme of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, or gifts, &amp;c. And <hi>pag.</hi> 37. he saith, It is the Baptisme of Christ, whereby all true Christians are baptised into fellowship with him, and onenesse with him, and so become wholly washed in the new Creature, or new Man, or baptised into the very name of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</q> Then, either these are both one by his confession, or else here is direct contradiction. But to take off this, he saith, <q>That of the Holy Ghost was a signe of this,</q> but here is no Scripture to prove it; therefore he that beleeveth it, hath but the word of man only for his faith. <hi>Pag.</hi> 274. he saith, <q>The pure, spirituall, glorious assurance of Salvation, commeth from the knowledge of God, or the pure manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit of God, bearing witnesse, or giving testimony that we are the Sons of God;</q> and this, saith he, is the unction whereby we know all things, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.20. And yet he saith in another page, The unction is those extraordinary gifts of the Spirit. So that by his owne confession, it is not only in gifts, but in Graces and fruits; And so we have Baptismes truly in Scripture sense, and all the Baptismes it speaketh of.</p>

               <p> And for the Doctrine of laying on of hands, it belongeth to every Christian in one sense or other; as I have proved in my Answer to the Exceptions.</p>

To leave, is one thing; and to leave off, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing. To leave off, is to forsake quite, <hi>Iob</hi> 9.27. But to LEAVE, is sometimes to goe about some other necessary, or more excellent thing, and so returne againe; not to forsake it quite, and not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, but sometimes exercised in it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Leave there thy gift, goe and be reconciled to thy brother, then come and offer thy gift, Mat.</hi> 18.12. <hi>He leaveth the ninety nine, and goeth after that which was lost, &amp;c.</hi> But he meaneth to returne to them againe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.5. <hi>A man shall leave his father, and mother, and cleave to his wife.</hi> Doth he meane, he must never doe ought for his Father and Mother more? No; but he must be more intimate and conversant with his wife, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.2. So it is here; we will not be alwaies exercising our selves in these principles, but in higher matters also: But he meineth not by leaving them, to throw them quite off.</p>

And was not Incense offered in the Temple, and blood sprinkled there? And was not there a Table, and Candlestick, and Shew bread, &amp;c. And did not the Priests goe performe services there? So that here is a paradox: Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ordinances cast out, and outward ordinances taken care for, by their owne exposition: So that they contradict themselves.</p>
               <p>But by Temple of God, is meant the true Church of God: as the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians are called, The Temple of the living God.

               <p>The Altar, signifieth the true Spirituall Altar Christ, upon whom all their prayers, and praises are offered, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.

<note place="margin">Contradictions amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, therefore all they say is not of the Spirit of God, as they give out.</note> that prophesied ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the measure that God had given them. Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> saith, They were Christ in flesh, and Christ in Spirit. Now these two, say they were both guided by the Spirit, and yet they give severall Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, one contrary to another. If this be true, that they were both guided by the Spirit, here will be an imputation cast upon the Spirit one way or other; If these Interpretations, or one of them be not true, then the Spirit is wronged to have them both cast upon it; If they were both of the Spirit, then the Spirit will be found to contradict it selfe, which cannot be;
<note place="margin">Joh. 16.13.</note> for it is the Spirit of Truth So that the Spirit is wronged, by these mens casting all that they deliver upon the Spirit; when they deliver some things contradictory to themselves, and also one to another; And yet the Spirit must be the Author. And in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular (I conceive) Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> mistaketh; For this is the Revelation of Jesus Christ <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.1. And he here saith, MY two witnesses;
<note place="margin">Mr. Sedgwick <hi>mistaken about the two witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>
                  </note> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it could not be he himselfe, especially in flesh; for so he was before this Revelation was given, and was ascended before (Mr. <hi>Saltm.</hi> saith) out of flesh into Spirit; And the Revelation was of things to come. Nor it could not be Christ in Spirit, but in men witnessing to him; It could not be Christ in flesh; for he was dead, buried, risen, and ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:165581:43"/>before this Revelation was given to <hi>John;</hi> yea he was buried, so was not these witnesses; Beside, these lay dead three dayes and a halfe, but he rose againe the third day. And it could not be Christ in Spirit, because Christ in Spirit cannot dye, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. nor lye dead, nothing being left but a carcasse.</p>
               <p>It is not possible but these men must wrong the Spirit, in making him the Author of all they deliver; because they say they are not infallible: But if they be not infallible, How dare they say that what they deliver is as God giveth it in, and from the Spirit? If they be infallible, why will they deny it, and so dishonour the Spirit, to make men they dare not so confidently rest upon them, which they might do, did they know they were infallible? And so the Spirits testimony is questioned by their owne words; for they say, That they deliver is bearing witnesse to God, and it is by the Spirit of God; and yet they are not infallible: And how can they maintaine the one, and not the other?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> in his Epistle to the Reader,</p>
               <p>Saith, <q>God is in all his severall dispensations and measures; and Christians are not to hasten out of any,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Replyes to some sayings of</hi> Mr. Saltmarsh <hi>in the Epistle to the Reader.</hi>
                     </note> till God himselfe say, Come up hither.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whence observe;</p>
               <p n="1">1 God hath his severall dispensations, and is in them: But Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme by water is his dispensation; for <hi>Peter</hi> commanded it, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. And breaking bread, is his dispensation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. Therefore (by HIS owne confession) God is in them: And therefore we are to continue in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <q>We are not to hasten, &amp;c.</q> Then those that hasten out of them to the Taverne, and Ale-house, to lye drinking there commonly; and to loosenesse of life, cannot say God hath called them up: This is downe sure. And those that hasten from Ordinances, backe to their common old road, to communion with Antichrists ministery, and members; to pay and receive Tythes, which they say they can doe, which is of the Law; is not comming up, but going down.</p>
               <p>Againe he saith, <q>He is not against Ordinances, so they proceed from their right principles, to their right ends. And page 55. For my part (saith he) I am farre from denying any Gospell forme, or way which appeareth to be the practice of the Saints then, because I conceive the Saints so gathering and practising, &amp;c. And page 281. God is seen in Ordinances, as in created things. And 287. Christians enjoy God sweetly in them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>See how he speaketh here. And yet he saith, page 119. <q>It shall be as much apostasie in the Saints to goe back to the first Ministery of Gospell times, which was the Ministery to the first discovery of the mystery hid from Ages, as it would be in them to goe back to Jewish Temple and Priesthood, &amp;c.</q> But hee proveth none of all this, nor
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:165581:43"/>much more that he speaketh after: for this is to deny Christ came in the flesh, and so to be an Antichrist. And saith <hi>Paul, If ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing,</hi> Gal. 5. See how strangely he contradicteth himselfe; confesseth truth, and then denyeth it againe.</p>
               <p>I reply a word or two more.</p>
               <p>If God be seen in Ordinances, Then he hath not left them,
<note place="margin">Ordinances maintained from his own sayi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gs.</note> as hee saith elsewhere, And it is lawfull to eye God in created things, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.1 <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. But God is seene in Ordinances more then in created things, even in instituted things, for those ends that God hath ordained them.</p>
               <p>And if it be not against them, why doth he plead against them so in his Booke? This very confession intimateth that in his conscience he was convinced that Christians ought to walke in them, and make use of them. But in the same Epistle it seemeth he counteth Baptisme with water, breaking bread, &amp;c none of Gods dispensations: for saith he, <q>I have spoken of the liberty of some that are spirituall, in some things of worship and discipline without sinne, yet of no other, but as the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God shall direct to edification, and care of offence, and Scriptures allow, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 9.22. <hi>To the weake I became weake, &amp;c.</hi> Those words under the Law containe liberty to things once Instituted;</q> [So that there he maketh Ordinances of the New Testament of the same nature of those under the Law, as Circumcision, &amp;c. or as Idolls] <q>Those words, without Law, to things not Instituted (saith he) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Idoll is nothing in the world.</q> [All outward forms of worship, are matters of liberty it seemeth; Liberty whether a man will preach, or declare Gods goodnesse, though there be a Command, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16 for that is a forme of words: And though <hi>Paul</hi> say,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.13. 1 Cor. 9.</note>
                  <hi>Woe is me if I preach not the Gospell.</hi> And a forme of wholesome words are to be held fast. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty whether a man will use words of prayer, or exhortation, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of God; for al these must be done in one form or other. So it seemeth it is in a mans liberty whether he will performe any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward service to God in his body or no: So that now it seemeth Christ hath no Commands, but hath left all things to mens liberty.] And to that purpose he pleadeth in his Book, as I have shewed.</p>
               <p>He seemeth to intimate that, That under the Law, and without Law, was liberty to things of former Institution by God, and of no Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But is there liberty from things of later Institution, I meane since Christ revealed in the flesh? or liberty to things forbidden by God, as Idol-worship? &amp;c. which he seemeth to plead for; for in that place of the Corinthians, We know an Idoll is nothing in the world;
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.</note>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh not to excuse those who worshipped the Idoll, or performed an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous service; But of such as did eat meat that was of the Idols sacrifice, the over-plus sold in the Shambles.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>He saith, There are two things make Ordinances in divine right
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:165581:44"/>stood for. 1. There is an opinion that there is a very modell in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be discovered; which is to reduce Christians to bondage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and to a forme without those very gifts, which are not to be found in the same.</q> Meaning (as I gather by his Booke) Apostolicall extraordinary gifts, speaking with Tongues and Miracles.</p>
               <p n="1">1 There is a Modell in the Scripture,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                  </label> how God will be worshipped; what the Church is, (I meane the visible Church) what members, and order, and ordinances, as in the first Epistle to <hi>Timothy;</hi> which charge he commandeth to keep till the appearing of Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">2 I deny that ever the Scriptures of the New Testament were called the Letter:
<note place="margin">What the Letter in the true sense of it is.</note> This is an unwholsome word, we have not footing for it in the Booke of God; so applyed. I confesse, I finde the outward part of the Ceremoniall Law, or Commandments of enmity contained in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances called, the Letter, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.27.29. Letter and Circumcision. Those outward ordinances of the Law. But that is Circumcision in the Spirit, not in the LETTER <hi>(i. e.)</hi> in the outward part according to the Law. And so <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. <hi>We are delivered from the Law,</hi> (meaning the Ceremoniall Law; for from the substance of the Law contained in love they were not delivered) that we should serve—not in the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the LETTER <hi>(i. e.)</hi> not in the Law; but according to the Gospell or Spirit. And so, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. where that which he calleth the LETTER, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. he calleth, The ministration of death, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. of condemnation, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. That which was made glorious, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. which is done away, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. And that which is called, Spirit, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. is called, The ministration of the Spirit, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. of Righteousnesse, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. That which excelleth in glory, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. That which remaineth, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. And the discourse from <hi>ver.</hi> 13. to the end, sheweth the Apostle speaketh of Law and Gospell; and not of outward parts, and inward. And so his conclusion is true, the modell in the Letter (that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, in the Law, and so himselfe expoundeth it, <hi>pag.</hi> 240.) tendeth to reduce Christians to bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>Another opinion is (saith he) <q>That the setting up of such a forme is an immediate way of fixing God and his Spirit upon it, which is a finer kinde of Idolatry, to conceive that God entereth into outward things, and conveyeth his all glorious, and Almighty Spirit by them; when as they are only signes, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answer;
<note place="margin">What he calleth a fine kinde of Idolatry, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</note> For my part I know none that hold this opinion; if Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> did, he might have done well to have laid open who they had been, and not to have made all that stand for ordinances to be reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because he hath written this: I make them not immediate wayes, (for that cannot be, seeing there is meanes used it cannot be immediate) nor mediate; but waite upon God in the use of them, for the discovery of himselfe, how, and when he pleaseth; And to discover to men my readinesse to obey God in whatsoever he commandeth, as <hi>Abraham</hi> in
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:165581:44"/>that command of offering his Son, went about it,
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.17. Gen. 22.2, &amp;c.</note> not as an immediate way of fixing God to it, but obeying God in what he commanded. A man may look upon God, and the enjoyment of God, and all for selfe, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58.2. But we use ordinances to manifest to men our obedience to God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we enjoy God in them or no.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Where God hath promised his presence, or Spirit, or comforts in the use of ordinances, or outward things, (as some terme them) I may expect his making it good, without any fine kinde of Idolatry at all, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23 <hi>Turne you at my reproofe; Behold, I will poure out my Spirit unto you, &amp;c.</hi> Men are to heare his reproofs which he proclaimeth; and in hearing this, there is hope of turning; and turning he promiseth there to poure out his Spirit, and make knowne his Word. It is no fine kinde of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try therefore to heare the Word,
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> and waite at the posts of Wisdomes doores when she cryeth: <hi>Faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the Word preached,</hi> and yet an outward thing; and this way the Galatians received the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. And yet not blamed for fine Idolaters for hearing the Word, and having faith wrought that way; and why should it be a fine kinde of Idolatry to waite for Gods discoveries in other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, that are no more outward then that? And he himselfe confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, God is enjoyed sweetly in them? Was not <hi>Peter</hi> one of these finer kinde of Idolaters, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. When he biddeth them repent, and be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and they should receive the gift of the Holy Ghost? And doth not Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> say, God gave them the Holy Ghost in the Apostles mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and it was promised (saith he) in the commission, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28? And was it a fine kinde of Idolatry therefore to expect it there? Thus you see when men run from Scripture, how they contradict themselves in what they write;
<note place="margin">Contradiction.</note> when God had promised his presence betweene the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims, over the propitiatory, was it any fine kinde of Idolatry to expect it there? See this mans owne confession, <hi>pag.</hi> 108. he saith, God did appeare in wayes of outward Administrations, as Tabernacle, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>He saith, That of Gods appearance and conveyance of himselfe in outward things, according to this opinion, is such as the Papists hold as to Images, and things conferring grace, <hi>Ex opere operato;</hi> and all Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters accordingly, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Doth Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> look upon the ordinances of Christ, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles instituting, which is all one; as an Image made by a Papist, or a Golden Calfe, made by Idolatrous Israel, directly against Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands? Then certainly they are to be rejected: And he saith, they are not, in the next words, in the same page, where he saith, <q>Christians sweetly partake of them, and God maketh heavenly things appeare by earthly; as <hi>Thomas,</hi> may see and beleeve.</q> But what heavenly thing doth God make appeare by Papists Images, or Israels Golden Calfe? or how sweetly did they partake of them, or of God in them? or what Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, figures, or types of Spirituall things were they? If ordinances be
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:165581:45"/>such, away with them, grind them to powder: The people of God are far from partaking of spirituall things in them; and from seeing any thing of Christ in the sides of an Image, and so to beleeve as <hi>Thomas</hi> did. If they be not alike; Then I wonder that men should make such similitudes, to work the hearts of people (who idolize their persons, and take all they say as an Oracle) to a base esteem of the Ordinances of God, by such unequall comparisons.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>He speaketh of a mystery of Satan; It is (saith he) to fortifie corrupt nature against the Spirit of God, and therefore counterfeiteth the spirit by false revelations, and appearances, as casting reproach upon the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; as praying by the spirit, and preaching by the spirit, and new revelations, and new light; thus making the world blaspheme, and the weaker Saints afraid of the glory of the spirit, lest it prove a delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 He saith, Satan counterfeiteth false Revelations, and appearances, And such Revelations and appearances there is, not onely in the world, but among such as are against Ordinances. For when they hold forth things directly contradicting one another, the one must needs be a false revelation or delusion. As to say, I own the Scripture to be the word of God;
<note place="margin">Contradictions noted.</note> and the same man to say, I know no other word of God but Christ; the one of these is a delusion, unlesse there be a further explication of the sayings.</p>
               <p n="2">2 He saith <q>It maketh the world blaspheme, and weaker saints afraid of the glory of the spirit.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I Answer, no; They are not afraid of that, but of receiving delusions for Truth. All the Saints are commanded to try the spirits, and not to beleeve every spirit; And because weaker Saints (as they please to tearm them that walk in the use of Ordinances, assuming strength to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) dare not receive every thing that they say is by the spirit, (though there be meer contradictions to Scripture, and their owne sayings one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong another,) This argueth not that they are afraid of the glory of the spirit, but that they desire to glorify the spirit.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> saith, <q>The perfecting of the saints, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. was in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<note place="margin">D.P.</note> and therefore that hath relation to Christ, and not to the gifts spoken of there.</q> Another of them saith, the perfecting of the saints, was for that Age only, because Apostles, &amp;c. do not continue. Here is a contradiction one against another.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> maketh the Baptisme of the spirit, to be the Baptisme of gifts, page 33. and yet pag. 39. he saith, it is the being Baptised into Christs spirituall body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. By one spirit are we all Baptised, &amp;c. That is another Baptisme, for we all have not those gifts. And if he mean they are one and the same, Why doth he distinguish them? If they be not one, why doth he make them one? So that here is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> saith, that the Gospel is the revelation of the mystery of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:165581:45"/>salvation in spirit only, in one place. And pag. 68. he calleth the Gospel Graces, or the second Heaven. pa. 106. He calleth the Gospel Christ. And Doctrine of Baptisms pa. 19. saith, The word preached is the Gospel. Here is contradiction againe.</p>
               <p>One saith, the ministery of the revelation is come, which he saith,
<note place="margin">D. P.</note> is the ministery of Christs God-head, Lord of Lords, and KING of KINGS And Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> pag. 123. saith, it is not the time of Christs reign.</p>
               <p>He that writeth the Doctrine of Baptismes, pa. 5, saith, speaking of those <hi>Act.</hi> 19. this Baptisme into the name of Christ, was not the repeating of any Water. Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> saith, it was alwayes with Water, and proveth it; and the Scripture is clear for it. Here is contradiction.</p>
               <p>He saith pa. 6. The greatest glory of the New Testament is, the Baptism of the spirit, which is that of gifts, as he instanceth in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> saith, the glory of the spirit in after times is greater. Here is one against another.</p>
               <p>He saith pag. 14. The Commission is, I would have you go teach all Nations. Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> saith, it is, Goe ye into all the world, I Disciple the Nations, and Baptise them. Here is contradiction among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>He saith pag. 19. Teaching the word, was the outward means of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising with the spirit, and saith <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. sheweth it; Others make the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands the outward meanes: So here is contradiction among themselves.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. with <hi>Mar.</hi> 16 shew, That teaching the word, is the outward meanes of begetting faith, and then those Beleevers have right to water Baptisme; That it sheweth: So <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. Go preach the Gospel—He that beleeveth and is Baptised shall be saved. I have noted these contradictions for this end; That the Reader may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that all that men say is of the spirit, is not so. TRY THE SPIRITS 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.1.</p>
               <p>I shall now come to speak to some sentences in Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> his book. He saith pag 15. <q>That is the true Church or body of Christ,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Some sentences in M.</hi> Saltmarsh <hi>book, answered.</hi>
                     </note> which is Baptised by one spirit, into onenesse, or unity of spirit; An unity or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation with Christ, being made perfect in one, even in one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I Answer, The Scripture speaketh also of particular Churches, that are true Churches But he saith, they were types of this, but bringeth no proof for it.</p>
               <p>He saith pag. 17. <q>This Church was the pillar and ground of Truth.</q> I Answer, so were particular Churches, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. for such a one was <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> in, the Church of the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3.</p>
               <p>Pag. 18, 19. He saith, <q>This Church is not to be divided by any outward thing, which is of this creation, which are visible, outward, or perishing. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.20, 21. Or by any fellowship, or Ordinances, below the glory of the spirit, which are part of the first Tabernacle.</q> [But the Ordinances
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:165581:46"/>of the Gospel are no part of it.] <q>And therefore whatsoever fellowship in pretence of Church notion, or Baptisme notion, or Presbiteriall notion, shall cast it self into any modell of the Letter</q> [That is of the Law.] <q>which alloweth not communion with other Beleevers in spirit,</q> [How shall we know them but by their works? Neither do we deny fellowship in spirit, with any that are in spirit,] <q>in whom the power of the spirit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed, but to be visible and apparent beleevers; though not in the practice of some particular Ordinance; such fellowships will in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ, or clearer revelations of Christ, see how they have offended many little ones.</q>
               </p>

And whether doth he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend most, that dare not walk contrary to what he findeth to be the rule of Scripture; or he that refuseth so to do, and will have no fellowship in Ordinances at all. <q>Whom in these outward things they ought to have pleased to edification; The law of love, and spirit, and life, being more excellent then any worldly rudiment whatsoever,</q>
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 2.20. [That is not Gospel Ordinances.] And why ought not they in these outward things to please their weak Brethren to edification, to walk in the use of them?</p>
               <p>If Baptism by water, and the Supper, be a signe and figure; and so le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall; and particular Churches, a signe and figure of the true Church; (as he saith it) is not the Scripture written also, a figure of the Law written in our hearts? And so when the spirit is revealed, the Scripture is flesh, of the first creation, &amp;c. And Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> his Preaching, is but a type or figure of the Preaching of Christ, the true Prophet; And so his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gospel was but Flesh, Carnall, a type of the first creation, &amp;c.</p>

                  <q>Pag. 31. He saith, Therefore we are said to be Circumcised with him in Baptism, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12.</q> The Spirit guided him not here; for it saith, BU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIED with him in Baptism.</p>
               <p>He saith, <q>Christ Baptized none, but his Disciples, <hi>John</hi> 4.1. so as his Disciples Baptised not as his only ministration, but from <hi>John;</hi> and as in his ministration, unto the Lord Jesus; as a ministration that was so acceptable to the Disciples;</q> And Pag. 80. he saith the same: (The Scripture saith it was Christs act, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. &amp; 4.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>He saith, pag. 33. <q>The Baptisme of water was called the Baptisme of Repentance, and manifestation to Israel; because the comming of Christ in the flesh, was the first opening of the mystery of Christ in the flesh to those who were under sin and bondage, as the Jews and Gentiles were, <hi>Act:</hi> 19.4. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.32.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He might have done well to have proved his reason from Scripture, we are not bound to beleeve it else; And are not Jews and Gentiles under sin and bondage now, as well as then? And therefore his reason holdeth good now as well as then. Beside, I conceive it is, That hee might be made manifest to Israel, The reason is, because he was to come to Israel after the flesh; and Israel looked for the Messiah; Therfore it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:165581:46"/>he should be made manifest to Israel. And beside, the word of grace was first tendered to Israel, and he was first sent to Israel.

               </p>
               <p>This was, be Baptised with water; for if it had been the Baptisme of the Holy Ghost, it had been non-sense; Bee Baptized with the Holy Ghost, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>Pag. 37, 38, 39, 40. He defineth what the Baptisme of Christ is, which he calleth. <q>His owne proper, and spirituall, and only ministration.</q>
               </p>
               <p>We doe not affirm that the Baptisme with water, is the Baptisme of Christ in this sense, because it is his own proper, and spirituall, and only ministration: But a thing ordained, and instituted by Christ, and so it is the Baptisme of Christ, as truly as the other. And so the Disciples prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching was truly the teaching of Christ, they being sent out to do it, as truely as his teaching the heart; though it was not his proper, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and only ministration. So the sufferings of the Saints, are called the sufferings of Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. So the Churches are called, the Churches of Christ, yet gathered, and planted by the Apostles and Disciples mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and not by his owne proper, and spirituall, and only ministration, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.16. Christ is said to work, and the works that he did are called, the works of Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.2. And yet the work that <hi>Epaphreditus</hi> did is called, the work of Christ too, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.30. So a man is called, a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Christ, not that he ministreth Christ himselfe, but is appointed of Christ to minister in the things of Christ, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.7. So the word of Christ is not only his owne proper, and spirituall, and only ministration; But the word of the Gospell, written by the Apostles, and Evangelists, and preached to us, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>He saith, <q>The Baptisme of Christ thus administred, in his own spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall nature upon his, is the very Baptisme by which we are in the fellowship of his sufferings and death.</q>

               </p>
               <p>[But I see no Scripture proofe for it.

To what time that relateth? 2. To what Church, or people? 3. What he meaneth by Temple? If he say, Gifts, and Ordinances, and Baptisme by water, &amp;c. Then he himselfe contradicteth himselfe, for he saith, these are the Court of the Temple given to the Gentiles.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I answer; 1. That every Christian is made under Circumcision with hands, I know no Scripture affirmeth it. He saith, <q>As Christ was in the world, so, &amp;c.</q> I say, every Christian was in the world. But if he meane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same dispensations, I say, No: for then every Christian must come into the Temple, and be Circumcised the eighth day.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And then (saith he) he crucified all that flesh, &amp;c. And if he will but allow us, that which he seemeth here to allow; That we shall be as Christ was under Baptisme, and the Supper of Bread and Wine till we dye, as the Scriptures cited proveth he was, why will he plead against it so? And this may serve for answer to the like thing affirmed, <hi>pag.</hi> 260.</p>
               <p>Pag. 70. He saith, <q>And while God lived in each ministration, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and glorifying, and acting it for himselfe, the presence of God, and of Spirit, was to the Disciples like the Sun in Summer shining up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; the candle of the Lord shining upon their heads, and his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret upon their Tabernacle: But when the line of Gods season was run out to its point, and extremity, that he would no longer stay there, nor have his glory inhabite in such and such a ministration; then that ministration became a place of desolation, a solitary place, for the Satire to dwell in, and the Scritch-owle to sing in <hi>(i.e.)</hi> for the spirit of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie and Antichrist to possesse, and act in, &amp;c.</q> And so he goeth on shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we should not abide in a ministration, when God hath left it.</p>
               <p>I say so too, when God hath utterly left it. But he hath not yet proved the ministration of Baptisme by Water, and the Supper, and other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are left of God. Where is the Bill of divorce that God hath given them? Is there no Christian under Baptism with water? if there be, Doe all his experiences faile him, that tell him, that he enjoyed God in that ordinance, and doth still sweetly in the use of the Supper? And if God have left these, and the Spirit also, why doth he tell Mr. <hi>Knollis,</hi> he is not against the Baptism of water; and it occasioneth abundance to fall off from their obedience, and some to loosenesse of life, and look upon Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:165581:49"/>as an <hi>Odium,</hi> by his writing this Book? And if God be gone from those Ordinances, and those that use them be possessed with a spirit of Apostasic, and Antichristianisme or iniquity; as he intimateth those are that continue in Ordinances when God is gone, or that they finde such a spirit dancing or singing there; How durst he say, he was not against it? For my part, I think all Christians should be against a spirit of Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and Antichristianisme, and Iniquity; and if God be not gone, but be still found there, how can he prove they be ceased, and carnall, and flesh, and only for the age of the Apostles?</p>
               <p>From <hi>Pag.</hi> 84-93. He maketh a discourse of the life of outward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, as he saith, and telleth us, what the new Creature is, and the true spirituall ministery by which he groweth up; and the true spirituall Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord; and Minister, and Pastor, and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Church, and Keyes, and Excommunication, and Gospel order, and Government, and Covenant, and Ordination, and Trial of gifts.</p>
               <p>I answer; If he meane there is no outward ministery, nor Baptism, nor Supper, nor Minister, nor Pastor, nor Elder, nor Church, nor Keyes, nor Excommunication, nor Gospel-order, &amp;c. And that all is false but that which he nameth; then it is against the cleare Scriptures of the New Testament; or else these Scriptures will prove of no use. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <q>The true Spirituall Minister is Jesus Christ,</q> saith he, &amp;c. Was <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> false Ministers therefore? If so, then <hi>Paul</hi> abuseth the people of God when he saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Let a man so account of us as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Christ:</hi> And yet these were not Christ. If he meane these things are truly Spirituall in way of preheminency to the outward, the life of them; not condemning the outward, I yeeld to him: But that I think is not his meaning; and then see whether this tendeth. There is no Church to be seen outwardly, if the Christian be the minde only; as Mr. <hi>George Hassell</hi> would have it; nor no outward order. What is being in the Church then,
<note place="margin">Job 10. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </note> but as being in the Grave, a place where there is no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? So that in the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. That reproveth idlenesse in outward calling as a disorderly walking, is nothing; idlenesse may be: that is no disorder now. Sins that both Law and Gospell condemneth are no disorder now. If they be, then there is a true Spirituall order out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, as well as the members differing one from another in glory, and spirit, and power. And he seemeth, <hi>pag.</hi> 90. to be of <hi>George Hassels</hi> mind, that the Spirit only is the Christian; <q>Christ being a spirituall head, hath a spirituall body.</q> It is true. But by his discourse he seemeth to meane a body only in spirit, and nothing outward; and so the outward members of the outward man may doe what he will, and walk loosly in all sin, for they are no part of Christs Body; yet he confesseth outward excommunication. <hi>pag.</hi> 306.</p>
               <p>Pag. 100. He saith, <q>There have been Christians in severall formes and worships, under Episcopacy, Prelacy, Presbitery, &amp;c. in all places among Jewes, and Gentiles.</q> [I yeeld to this, yet give us leave to say
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:165581:49"/>according to Scripture truth, The Churches which are false, are false; in their constitution, order, &amp;c. Beare with us, for your censure of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations possessed with a spirit of Apostacy, Antichristianisme, and iniquity, is as harsh. We confesse true Christians, possessed with the Spirit of God, though living in Churches of false constitution, as Gentile Idolatrous societies were; and though God had his people there, this will not warrant their staying there, when once they see the evill of it.</p>
               <p>Pag. 109. He saith, <q>Before the Administrations God was in, as Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, Temple, Priests, Prophets, &amp;c. which God laid by, he never appeared in them more: Nor Christ when he had once ended his Administration in the flesh, he never restored it in that very way againe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I say no; he never did, nor intended to suffer more: But he declared to his Disciples the things concerning his Kingdome, in his Body, before his Ascention, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And so in all reformations, respectively to these former Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they never returned back, or re-assumed the same againe, after once God refused it, or laid it by: When Christ came in the flesh, he did not make it his work to settle the Priesthood againe, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answer; When God layeth by an Administration utterly, forever; then indeed the people of God are to lay it by, and re-assume it no more; but not till then. Now where hath God laid by preaching of the Gospel, or baptisme with water, of the Supper?</p>
               <p>Againe, the Priests, &amp;c. were types of Christ, and his comming in the flesh was to put an end to them; among other ends, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. so that if he had setled them againe, he had fought against himselfe in it. Prove the same of these Ordinances or Administrations.</p>
               <p>He saith, <q>The falling away hath put an end to them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answer; Where will any Scripture prove, that Apostacy, or the creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of Anti-christ putteth a finall end to any Administration of God? This is an enemy to God, and the Saints; and when enemies have spoyled them of administrations, they have taken them up againe; as the Jewes, concerning their first and second Temple. But when Christ putteth an end to them, then they are no more to be used. Israel Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stated and fell away from the worship of God often-times under Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Kings: yet the godly Kings re-assumed it againe, till Christ came, and put an end to that kinde of service. Israell Apostatized from dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Booths; yet finding it in the Word as their duty, they took it up againe: And there was no end put to it by their Apostacy, till Christ came, who was the end of those types and shadowes. And if we have figures and types now under the Gospell, as he saith we have; then it must be Christs comming must lay them by, and not Apostasie. Israell being recovered from Babilon, built her Temple againe, and set up her Administrations: And though God was gone, as in <hi>Ezekie.</hi> I proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:165581:50"/>yet he came againe when it was built againe. So the Israell of God recovering from mysticall Babilon, may take up her Ordinances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, though they have been corrupted by Anti-christ, and God gone in that respect: till Christ reveale otherwise. And since the people of God have re-assumed them, God hath come againe, and been seen and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them; and they have found God in Sodome, and Christ in the Grave; if Ordinances be Sodom, and the Grave (as he intimateth.) And for those extraordinary gifts which the Church hath not, she cannot take them unlesse God give them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Is not Preaching an administration that was from Christs time to the falling away? And was not Doctrine corrupted by Anti-christ, as well as other Ordinances?
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.1, 2.</note> And were not gifts gone from false Doctrine as well as from false Worships? Did not false Teachers creepe in, and bring in damnable Heresies, as well as false Worships, and corrupt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances? What warrant is there then to re-assume Doctrine, but to wait upon the higher teachings of the Spirit, seeing this was laid by at the time of Apostasie and corruption, as well as other Ordinances?</p>
               <p>Pag. 110. He saith, <q>The falling away was no more, but the Lord ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering up, and taking in the out-goings and operations or gifts of the Spirit, in such ministrations.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answer; When the Lord gathereth up his Spirit, no man can have it in any ministration; that is true. But the gathering up of those gifts did not prove the ceasing of Ordinances, as Baptisme with water, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gospell, the Supper: Neither hath the Lord said any where, they shall cease; neither hath he revealed it, that they were ordained upon some speciall Reason, and then to cease; as gifts and miracles were for confirmation of the word then spoken, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. <hi>ult. Heb.</hi> 2.2. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the one might cease, and God gather up one? and the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, that was not given for that end.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It seemeth by this affirmation, it was long of God that men fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, whereas the Scripture sheweth it was their owne corruption; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause iniquity aboundeth, the love of many shall wax cold, and because of false Teachers,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.1, 2. <hi>And</hi> Heb. 3. <hi>Take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Pag. 114. He calleth the Saints, <q>Spirituall vessels, or Golden cups of the Lords Temple, carried away captive, and live under the flesh.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answer; If so, then when the Lord bringeth them out of Captivity, they may returne and build their Temple; I meane, not only Christ in Spirit; but all those Ordinances that he left them in his Word to walke in.</p>
               <p>He saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 121. <q>All that pretended refomatrion by gifts and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:165581:50"/>Ordinances, which tendeth to the reducing of us to that first Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Apostles times, which they of the Presbytery, Independency, and Baptisme endeavour; is but a building up those things which the Lord would have destroyed, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answer; 1. This is not proved; and beside, we have warrant from Christ to reduce things to their first purity, so neare as we can, when they are out of order; as I have shewed.</p>
               <p>He saith, <q>And therefore the Lord suffered the Man of Sinne to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile upon it, &amp;c.</q> I answer; Did it follow, that because the Babilonians of old prevailed over the people of Israel, and destroyed their Temple, and worships; that therefore it was Gods minde to have it utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed for ever? No such matter. Neither doth it now follow, that because the Man of Sin prevailed through the negligence of the Church, therefore God would have his Ordinances in the first purity destroyed. This is but reason, and he that writeth it giveth no Scriptuie proofe for it.</p>
               <p>Page 115. In describing what is the Beast, and false Prophet, and Whore, he saith, <q>This is the Whore too; for when the Spirit is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from God, and the life of God, is become an Adultresse; having lost its first love, or husband, even the Lord himselfe; and sitteth upon a Beast, even the flesh, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, This is the Spirit of whoredome, but there is whoredome in act also; And so he confesseth, <q>That Antichrist worketh as well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out to the world, as within in the flesh of every Saint.</q> And therefore though the false Prophet, and Beast, and Whore, be within in the spirits of false Prophets, Beasts, Whores; yet they are without also.</p>
               <p>Page 132. He asketh, Where are those gifts of pure anointing now?</p>
               <p>I answer, In the Scripture: And so farre as Pastors and Teachers teach the truths of Scripture, so farre they teach the pure Anointing.</p>
               <p>Page 249. He affirmeth, <q>That the Jewes were but figures of the children of the Bona-woman, and of Christians under the Apostasie, in meer letter, and corrupt formes of worship: And as the Jews were reckoned before to be the people of meer Ordinances, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I reply, The Apostle speaketh of calling that very people that were broken off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Hath God cast away his people whom he foreknew? God forbid,</hi> saith <hi>Paul.</hi> How doth he prove he hath not? <hi>For I also</hi> (saith he) <hi>

And so he goeth on to shew that as God had a remnant of them in <hi>Elijahs</hi> time, when the rest were fallen to <hi>Baals</hi> Idolatry; So at this time (saith he) God hath a remnant of the same people, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5. Againe he speaketh of such Jewes, that the Gentiles, other Nations were opposed to, such as were the Romans, as <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13.30. 4 He speaketh of a people which he calleth, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. them that are his flesh, whom he desired to provoke to emulation, and save some of them; Therefore it is that people: And this may serve for answer to that that he saith, Page 250. <q>That the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:165581:51"/>calling of the Jewes is nothing else but bringing the Christian from Letter to Spirit.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Page 254. he saith, <q>Christ in us, is when we are made the Anointed of God, which is the Christ, or the whole entire Christ as one spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall new man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12.</q> [So that by this Doctrine we are as much Mediator, Redeemer, Justifier, as Christ, that was borne of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and suffered at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Beside, the place of Scripture he citeth calleth the Church Christ, in relation of body to Head; and not that every Saint is as whole entire Christ as he.</p>
               <p>Page 256. He maketh the fiery triall spoken of by <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <q>To be a going out of more Legall administrations, to lesse Legall, or more Gospell, &amp;c.</q> Whereas the Apostle speaketh of persecutions, of being reproached for the Name of Christ, and suffering not as a murtherer, nor theefe, &amp;c. but as a Christian, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14.16. This is the fiery try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he speaketh of, and not the other.</p>
               <p>Page 265. he saith, <q>The six dayes were a figure of Christians under bondage, or working administrations, as those of the Law and Gospell are; as all Forms of worship, duties, graces, prayers, or Ordinances, &amp;c.</q> And some say, All outward things are Forms. So that by this Tenet, All outward duties, graces, prayers, ordinances, are ceased, to them that are in God or Christ. If they mean dissolved, and with Christ, as <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, I say so too; but else I require their Scripture proofe for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Consider, here is affirmed, that all duties and graces too, are bondage; so that all acts of righteousnesse and holinesse, all spirituall qualifications are a bondage; here is either loosenesse or nothing.</p>
               <p>Page 246. he saith, <q>The New Covenant, or God revealed in his, is not by any outward way, or ministration, or means, but by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or unction, or anointing; Ye are all taught of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>No man shall teach his Neighbour or Brother, saying, know the Lord:</hi> And all conference, or discovery in letter or speech, is but meer witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to the Lord, and discovery of God of what we are taught, not any Ministery (as formerly) for teaching.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answer 1. <hi>That ye shall be all taught of God,</hi> is teaching men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and come to Christ; as appeareth clearly, <hi>Joh</hi> 6.44, 45, 46, 47, 48. And it is true, God alone teacheth the heart to beleeve, but yet by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means; <hi>For faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the word of God,</hi> Rom 10.17. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> not by Christ alone, as some would have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther word of God; but by the word of Faith, or Gospell preached, as appeareth <hi>ver.</hi> 14.15. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. Yea the whole sequell of the Chapter, <hi>Rom</hi> 10. maketh it cleare, witnesse the saying of <hi>Isay</hi> to prove that <hi>Israel</hi> heard the word of God. Concerning <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. I have answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, in the objection upon <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. And in the objection that none may preach but infallible men.</p>
               <p>Page 247. he saith, <q>No outward Ordinance or ministration of the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:165581:51"/>creature, or of the letter, can convey, or conferre, or bring in pure spirituall things, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. There is a great mistake in that; they are but signes and shadows of spirituall things; and they are to the Spirit in the New Testament, as the shadows in the Old were to the flesh of Christ, figures, and perishing things, and to be fulfilled in Spirit, and in the comming of Spirit, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.20.1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26.</q>
               </p>
               <p>See how he here overthroweth preaching; is not that an outward Ordinance? And saith he, They are to be fulfilled in Spirit, and the comming of the Spirit, and citeth 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. which some plead for lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe breaking of bread. And saith he, No outward Ordinance, &amp;c. I wonder why they doe not lay down preaching, exhorting, instructing, witnessing to God; their words are but outward things.</p>
               <p>Beside, we say not, They can convey pure spirituall things; but God can convey them in the use of outward Ordinances: As faith commeth by hearing.</p>
               <p>Page 265. he saith, <q>The first patterne in Scripture of Offices and Ordinances, was but a more purely legall dispensation or a discovery of the Gospel, rather as to Christ after the flesh then after the Spirit, and a discovery, as to the weaknesse both of Jewes and Gentiles then, respectively to visible administrations, and gifts of Spirit.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, It was the minde of Christ concerning his Kingdome; for the Apostles preached it up, and acted it, and that by Commission from Christ; for in the forty dayes he conversed with them, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. he spake of things concerning the Kingdome of God.</p>
               <p>He saith, <q>God never set up any Administration, or Office, but for a time and season, and used it as a temporary dispensation, as the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, Temple, Law, Priesthood, &amp;c. and then left them never to be restored; So the first Gospell administration of Ordinances, Gifts, &amp;c. And yet he saith, page 278. There is a knowledge of God by outward Ordinances, and duties.</q> Here is contradiction. If God have left them, How can he be known by them?</p>

               <p>It is strange, And we read not in the whole Law of any such Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; But it was a thing as he confesseth, immediately revealed from

               <p>He maketh a long Discourse to prove the Baptisme of <hi>John</hi> and Christ distinct; [which need nor be, we acknowledge it; but when we mention the Baptisme of Christ, and mean water; we mean not that Christ admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred that Ordinance; we can distinguish of such things, The teaching of Christ by his Spirit, and the teaching of Christ by his Servants, and yet both the teachings of Christ, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. So the Baptisme of Christ administred immediately from Christ by his Spirit, and the Baptisme of Christ by water, administred by Christs Servants by his Commission; and yet both the Baptisme of Christ.</p>
               <p>Page 6. He saith, <q>So far as <hi>John</hi> preached Christ spiritually, he did it not as Baptist, but as <hi>John</hi> a beleever.</q> [Was not <hi>John</hi> a Baptist as he was a beleever? Was he not sent from God to Baptise? And doth he send unbeleevers upon any spirituall worke about his worship? And did not God give him a Commission to Preach and Baptise both, as he was a beleever? Here is a needlesse distinction.</p>
               <p>Page 9. He saith, <q>Some baptised with <hi>Johns</hi> Baptisme, did not know the way of God perfectly; that is (saith he) had no certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ, the way of God, as <hi>Apollo, Act.</hi> 18.</q> [This is contrary to Scripture; for it saith, <hi>He taught diligently the things of the LORD;</hi> And saith, in the same place, <hi>He was instructed in the WAY of the LORD.</hi>] <q>And some of them did not so much as know whether there were any Holy Ghost, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. much lesse had received the Spirit.</q> [How could they beleeve then?
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.22.</note> Is not faith a fruit of the Spirit? But they did not know those gifts of the Holy Ghost that afterward they received]</p>
               <p>He saith, <q>Repentance and Remission of sins is the work of Christs owne Baptisme,</q> which is the Baptisme of the Spirit, [But this is not the Baptisme of fire which he said was Christs owne Baptisme, and came upon the Apostles at Penticost; for they had Repentance and Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins before, That onely was gifts.</p>
               <p>Page 10.
<note place="margin">Mat. 19 28. Luke 10.20.</note> He saith, <q>Sin was remitted in hope onely in <hi>Johns</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, but really in Christs.</q> [It seemeth then by this, That the Apostles that followed Christ in the regeneration, it was onely in hope; And their names written in the Booke of life onely in hope, till Penticost: But the Scripture speaketh no such thing. And we are not to think of men above what is written.</p>
               <p>'The Kingdome of God is a Spirituall Kingdome, saith he [It is and spiritually outward, as well as inward: It consisteth in Righteousnesse, &amp;c. And Righteousnesse is not all inward, but outward Righteousnesse in life, as well as in heart, And Baptisme of water is acknowledged by
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:165581:52"/>Christ to be a part of Righteousnesse: So that it was of the Kingdome.]</p>
               <p>He saith, <q>It hath been the mistake of many Ages, that have made <hi>Johns</hi> Baptisme equall to Christs.</q> [I thinke never any so simple to make water equall to the Spirit: But to make water Baptisme of Christs Institution, and so <hi>Johns</hi> the same, is no mistake.</p>
               <p>Page 11. Speaking of the duration of <hi>Johns</hi> Baptisme he saith, <q>It was very short, It continued till Christs Ascention.</q> [But where doth the Scripture say, or shew, it ended then, or that <hi>John</hi> was a type of Christ? He was Christs Messenger before his face not his type.

               <p>He saith, <q>One single man with the word may very sawfully and justly contradict the whole world without it.</q> [I say it is very true; but he meaneth in disproving water Baptisme, &amp;c.

               <p>Pag. 20, 21. He sheweth, <q>This baptism of the Spirit</q> (which as he explaineth it, is nothing but regeneration, or conversion to Christ, being made one with him by faith and the baptism of fire, or spirit that he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before) he saith, <q>This giveth us a new nature, a new name, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth us into a new world, enableth us to the ministery of the New

So that in this place <hi>Peter</hi> putteth an end to baptism in the flesh, as <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 2.28. putteth an end to Circumcision in the flosh, saying, <hi>He is not a Iew which is one outwardlys neither is that eircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision which is in the flesh, &amp;c.</hi> that is, saith <hi>Paul, In the kingdom of Christ where all things are spirituall, circumcision in the Spirit, putteth an end to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision in the flesh;</hi>

               <p>[Yet faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God preached, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. And preaching is an outward thing, and he himselfe saith, out of the <hi>Ephes.

So here he contradicteth himselfe. <q>And therefore Christ hath put an end to all outward, and carnall, and earthly things of the first Testament;</q> [That is true: we stand for outward and inward of the second Testament; <hi>This cup of the NEW Testament, in MY bloud,</hi> saith Christ, not the first Testament. <q>And by his owne death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection only, not without us, but within us, through the power and efficasie of the Spirit, all the Baptisme of the New Testament is
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:165581:54"/>fully and perfectly performed;</q> It seemeth by this conclusion, that the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of gifts is no baptism of the New Testament, for that was without us, an externall thing. <hi>There appeared to them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sate upon</hi> (not in) <hi>each of them, &amp;c.</hi> And what then? <hi>They spake with tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.</hi> So that either this baptism (or at least the effects of it, by this mans conclusion) was not of the New Testament; for their speaking was outward.</p>
               <p>He said, <q>Baptism saveth the Church now, as the Floud did the Church then.</q> [Then it seemeth it was outward Salvation; for that was so: And then it may be outward baptism] for his Comment upon it, let that passe. But he saith, <q>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> put an end to baptism in the flesh, as <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c.</q> [That is not at all, for <hi>Paul</hi> doth not there put an end to it; for that was Christs worke, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p>But I conceive by his speech he meaneth, <hi>Peter</hi> declareth an end put to it. But the text saith, nor sheweth no such thing. All that can be gathered is, That the putting away the filth of the flesh doth not save: and I know no Anabaptist for my part that affirmeth it saveth. But doth this declare that there is an end put to water baptism, because it saveth not? Where <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. neither is there Salvation in any other, doth this prove that <hi>Paul</hi> put an end to all things under Heaven among men, not to be used, because they did not save? By this Argument an end had been put to Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, and all the Sacrifices long before they were ended. Mark what God saith, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43.11. <hi>Besideme there is no Saviour, I have declared, and saved, &amp;c.</hi> &amp; <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.21. <hi>A just God and a SAVIOVR, there is none beside me.</hi> Now if one had said here, <hi>Isaiah</hi> put an end to all outward Ceremonies, Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Circumeision, should not he have wrested this Scripture? It was a Law in <hi>Israel,</hi> that the people should confesse their sins over the Goat, or Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and <hi>Aaron</hi> should make attonement for them, Now saith God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43.25. <hi>I am he that blotteth out thine iniquity for my names sake;</hi> should I reason according to truth, if I should say, God put an end to putting the Hand upon the head of the Sacrifice, he will take away sin himself? And this is not the saying of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> but God himself. But Christ put an end to them, and declared that God would have them no longer in plaine termes, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7, 8, 9. And so doth the Scripture concerning all the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Sacrifices. But no such Scripture concerning either baptisme with Water, the Supper, Preaching, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Pag. 25. He saith, <q>The Baptism of the Spirit is sufficient now in the dayes of the Gospel and New Testament, as Christ himself only is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to the faithful, without <hi>Iohn,</hi> &amp;c.</q> [So he was without <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> or any of their Epistles, or Scripture; Are these things not to be used there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? <hi>Who is</hi> Paul, <hi>or who is</hi> Apollo, <hi>but Ministers by whom yee beleeved?</hi>

               <p>But there is a sufficiency of returnes to God in way of obedience, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Who is sufficient for these things?</hi>) that we may glorifie him before men, for that he calleth for: And that must be by inward and outward obedience according to the rule of Scripture and Spirit, <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risie God in your bodies and spirits,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.20.</note> which are Gods.</hi> And he is sufficient to inable us to this also; but no sufficiency freeth us from obedience.</p>
               <p>I shall hereto adde an Answerto one or two passages in Mr. <hi>George Hassals</hi> book, which some admire, and use the same words.</p>
               <p>The Apostle (saith he) in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. saith, <q>He preached the Gospell through infirmity of the flesh,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>An answer to a Scripture mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in</hi> Mr. Has<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals <hi>booke, and indeed the whole booke hath little truth in it.</hi>
                     </note> being then under a low and fleshly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, &amp;c.</q> And so he goeth on to shew that while <hi>Paul</hi> preached up Ordinances, and Rudiments (as he calleth them) they received him as an Angell of God; but when he came to preach up a Ministration above Ordinances, then they counted him their enemy: And saith he, <q>They are so fast glewed to their formes, they cannot endure sound Doctrine; And <hi>Paul</hi> was counted their enemy, because he came not to them in the same Ministration that formerly he came to them in, but in a higher, and more spirituall,</q> [To that he saith, Came to them in a Ministration above Ordinances, I say, above legall Ordinances, but no other. And so he did at first, even in a dispensatioa of Spirit. And that which he calleth infirmity of the flesh, is either persecutions or troubles which he endured for the Gospels sake, and so it seemeth to be by the next verse; for saith he, <hi>My temptation which was in the flesh ye despised not;</hi> And persecutions are called temptations, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.3. Or else he stoopeth to their weaknesse, in allowing them for a time some legall Ordinances, as <hi>To the Jew, I became a Jew, &amp;c.</hi> But what is this to Gospell Ordinances?</p>
               <p>To that he saith <hi>Paul</hi> came not to them in the same Ministration, &amp;c. I say he did; for <hi>Paul</hi> preached not another Gospel: He biddeth them, <hi>If be or an Angel from heaven preached any other Gospel then that he MAD preached;</hi> (Not that he NOW preached as if he changed his preaching, but that he preached at first) <hi>let him be accursed,</hi> Gal. 1. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Now saith he, <q>This blessed Apostle, after Christ was formed in him, and that he was brought to live in the third heavens in Spirit, how earnest and desirous is he to have all them that formerly he had had society with, and had preached the Gospell through infirmity unto, to have the like spirituall enjoyments in them, and to be brought up to the same perfection and unity of spirit with himselfe;</q> [And was not Christ formed in <hi>Paul</hi> till then? There he contradicteth himselfe; for he saith, Chap. 1.16. <hi>When it pleased God to reveale his Son IN me, that I might preach him among the heathen, &amp;c.</hi> So that before ever <hi>Paul</hi> preached,
<note place="margin">D. P.</note> Christ was formed in him. And for his living in the third heaven, one of his owne judgement saith, It was not a ministration then,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:165581:55"/>but <hi>Paul</hi> saw it in a vision; This man saith, he lived in it then in spirit; And Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> saith, It was the ministration in Spirit.
<note place="margin">Contradiction.</note> So that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ontradict themselves in this also.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now <hi>Paul</hi> was made partaker of the divine nature, saith he;</q> [And not till now, not before? I had thought he had been partaker of the divine nature when Christ was revealed in him, and he was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all conferring with flesh and bloud; so high in spirit before ever he preached the Gospel, and it was the same Gospell the other Apostles preached, as appeareth <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <q>He could as well comprehend the Sea in the hollow of his hand as conceale it. The divine nature is love; and here you might see this nature in <hi>Paul,</hi> for after he knew the onenesse and unity of the Saints with the Father, he must make it knowne unto them.</q> [So he did afore when he preached the Gospell through infirmity of the flesh; for then he knew it, he knew and see the just one at his conversion, before hee preached the Gospell, <hi>Act.</hi> 22 14, 15. <q>And yet they kept close to their old formes.</q> [That is not so, for that was Idolatry: But the false teachers would have led them to Jewish forms, which were abolished by Christ. And so he goeth on, adding more words to this purpose.</p>
               <p>But to give a briefe Answer, beside what is inserted, which might suffice; I say, The Gallathians had men crept in among them which did preach up Circumcision, and keeping the Law, like those spoken of <hi>Act.</hi> 15. Yea that they could not be justified nor saved, except they kept the Law; for that was their Doctrine, as appeareth, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.1.5. And that such were among the Gallatians now, appeareth by the whole Epistle. Consider well, Chap. 1.6, 7, 8. and 2, 3, 4, 5. and 4.3.4, 5, 21, &amp;c. and 5.2, 3, 4. And see clearly that they had men that taught these le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall things, and they joyned them with Christ, to Justification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, Chap, 4.17, 18. <hi>It is good,</hi> saith he, <hi>to be zealously affected in a good thing, and not onely when I am present with you;</hi> shewing by means of these men they were fallen from what they professed when he was present, or in danger of falling: for saith he, Chap. 1. <hi>I marvell ye are so soon removed to another Gospell!</hi> (So that he led them not higher, but endeavoured to establish them in the the same that he had preached.) And what these men were, that did so zealously affect them, that endeavoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Apostles out of their affections, and get in themselves; hee sheweth, Chap. 6.12, 13. Such as made a faire shew in the flesh, and would constraine them to be circumcised, and yet themselves kept not the Law. So that you see clearly the meaning of <hi>Paul</hi> is, That the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians receive the Gospell which he preached to them, and were so glad of him the Messenger of Christ, that they would have plucked out their eyes to have done him good: But now, by these Legall circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion teachers creeping in, their mindes began to be alienated, both from the plaine simplicity of the Gospell, and from him the Minister of it; And that he told them, they were justified by Christ alone, and freed

               <p>And were there not great divisions upon the Apostles preachings: It is by reason of mens corruptions that will not yeeld to truth, and not because of Order and Ordinances, if the Scripture might judge: But this I say as Christ did,
